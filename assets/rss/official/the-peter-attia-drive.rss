      <title>#163 - Layne Norton, Ph.D.: Building muscle, losing fat, and the importance of resistance training</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<div>Layne Norton is a physique coach, a natural professional bodybuilder and powerlifter, and holds a Ph.D. in nutritional sciences. In this episode, Layne explains how he became interested in weightlifting and fitness both professional and academically. He provides insights into preventing and managing injuries while using consistency and determination to boost his professional success in bodybuilding and powerlifting. Peter and Layne also review the science of body composition and what’s really driving muscle growth, including the role of nutrition, supplements, and a number of important and misunderstood hormones important to muscle protein synthesis. Furthermore, Layne stresses the importance of maintaining muscle mass even while losing fat for improving metabolic health and longevity and provides the keys to developing healthy habits. </div><div><br>We discuss:</div><ul><li>Layne’s childhood and why he gravitated towards weightlifting and bodybuilding [2:15];</li><li>Layne’s academic path, overcoming ADHD, and kicking Adderall [11:15];</li><li>Paradoxical observations about expertise, and Layne’s career transition to health and fitness [21:30];</li><li>The power of persistence and resilience in the face of setbacks [31:45];</li><li>Battling injuries, managing back pain, and setting lifting records [42:30];</li><li>Bodybuilding vs. powerlifting: comparing and contrasting the training approaches [56:45];</li><li>Cutting weight without losing muscle mass: exercise and dietary protocols, fasting, and a look at the literature [1:05:30];</li><li>Muscle protein synthesis and the importance of leucine [1:25:00];</li><li>Nitrogen balance and muscle protein synthesis, and the regulatory role of hormones for fat flux and muscle growth [1:36:30];</li><li>What’s really driving muscle growth: intrinsic vs. systemic factors, IGF, and hormone signaling [1:46:00];</li><li>The role of protein, carbohydrates and insulin on muscle growth and preservation, and the importance of context when interpreting study results [1:55:00];</li><li>Clarifying the role of cortisol—a misunderstood hormone [2:07:15];</li><li>The problem with studies trying to isolate one nutrient [2:14:30];</li><li>The important role of inflammation from exercise [2:18:55];</li><li>Keys to preserving muscle, and the value of habits, consistency, and resilience [2:23:00]; and</li><li>More.</li></ul>]]>

      <title>#162 - Sarah Hallberg, D.O., M.S.: Challenging the status quo of treating metabolic disease, and a personal journey through a grim cancer diagnosis</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<div>Sarah Hallberg is the Medical Director at Virta Health and a physician who has spent nearly two decades treating patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes. In the first half of this episode, Sarah discusses how she became a huge believer in the efficacy of carbohydrate restriction for the treatment of type 2 diabetes through her research and clinical experience. Sarah challenges the common beliefs about the role of dietary fat and carbohydrate on the plasma makeup of fatty acids and triglycerides. She also expresses the importance of understanding early predictors of metabolic illness—highlighting one particular fatty acid as the most important early predictor—before finishing with a discussion about how doctors might be able to personalize patients’ metabolic management in the future. In the second half of this episode, Sarah tells the personal story of her own lung cancer diagnosis. She talks about dealing with her grief, deciding to continue her work while prioritizing her family, and how she devised a plan to extend her survival as long as possible.  </div><div><br>We discuss:</div><ul><li>How Sarah discovered the profound impact of carbohydrate restriction for reversing obesity and type 2 diabetes [3:45];</li><li>Prediabetes and metabolic syndrome: prevalence, early signs, and the importance of treating early [15:30];</li><li>Overview of fatty acids, how they are metabolized, and understanding what you see in a standard blood panel [28:45];</li><li>The relationship between diet composition and metabolic markers [34:45];</li><li>Why palmitoleic acid is such an important biomarker [47:45];</li><li>The best early indicators of metabolic disease [59:30];</li><li>Personalized management of metabolic illness [1:06:30];</li><li>Sarah’s cancer diagnosis and the beginning of her journey [1:14:45];</li><li>The emotional impact of a devastating diagnosis [1:26:45];</li><li>Sarah’s plan to extend survival [1:36:15];</li><li>Sarah’s aggressive treatment plan [1:47:00];</li><li>Life-threatening complications and the return of her cancer [1:58:30];</li><li>Sarah’s reflections on her approach to life with chronic cancer and balancing her time [2:10:30]; and</li><li>More.</li></ul>]]>

        <description>
          <![CDATA[<div>Paul Offit is a pediatrician specializing in infectious diseases and an expert in virology and vaccine development. He currently serves on the FDA committee evaluating COVID-19 vaccines. In this episode, Paul’s second appearance on <em>The Drive</em>, he provides an update on all the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines currently deployed, explains why the concerns raised around the mRNA vaccines are not legitimate, and offers his view on the prospects and timeframe of reaching herd immunity. He also takes a deep dive into immunology, explaining the short-term and long-term immune response to both natural infection and vaccination and how these two can function together to provide durable immunity. Additionally, they discuss the theories on the origins of this virus, what impact the new COVID-19 variants might have, and the recent pausing of the J&amp;J vaccine.

          <![CDATA[<div>Peter Hotez is an internationally recognized physician-scientist in neglected tropical diseases and vaccine development. In this episode, they first follow up on <a href="https://peterattiamd.com/BrianDeer/">the podcast episode (#158) with Brian Deer</a> (the investigative journalist who exposed the complex and disturbing story behind the infamous 1998 Lancet paper by Andrew Wakefield linking the MMR vaccine and autism) with a broader discussion about the origin and evolution of the anti-vaccine movement. They explore some of the specific claims being made around vaccine additives, the timing of when vaccines are given, and claims about issues with the HPV vaccine specifically. Next, Dr. Hotez shares his own journey as a parent of an autistic child and speaks of the challenges of diagnosing autism, what could account for the seeming increase in the prevalence, and whether there is any support for the notion that environmental triggers play a role. They close out with a discussion on the state of affairs with respect to COVID-19 vaccination, comparing the various vaccines as well as the challenges that emerging variants of the virus may present.

      <title>#153 - AMA #21: Deep dive into olive oil, high-intensity exercise, book update, and more</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<div>In this “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) episode, Peter and Bob take a deep dive into olive oil. They explore the history of olive oil, discuss observational data that led to the hypothesis that olive oil is a healthier alternative to many other fats, and they explain the classification of olive oil types —including what to look for in a high-quality “extra virgin” olive oil. Peter and Bob round out the discussion with a “two-minute drill,” in which Peter answers questions from subscribers. They cover zone 5 training, an update on Peter’s book, lactate meters, standing desks, massage guns, electrolyte supplementation, and more. <br><br>We discuss:</div><ul><li>The early history of olive oil and the Mediterranean diet (2:15);</li><li>The three broad categories of fats: SFA, MUFA, and PUFA (6:25);</li><li>Exploring the hypothesis that olive oil is healthy (10:30);</li><li>Comparing olive oil to the makeup of other common oils (30:00);</li><li>Defining “extra virgin” olive oil, what to look for when purchasing, and Peter’s favorite brand (34:30);</li><li>Update on Peter’s book (47:15);</li><li>Zone 5 training: Peter's approach to zone 5 training, and other anaerobic training protocols (49:30);</li><li>Advantages of using a standing desk compared to sitting (55:30);</li><li>Lactate meters and strips (57:45);</li><li>Electrolyte supplementation during fasting and ketosis, and why uric acid may increase (59:30);</li><li>The usefulness of massage guns, foam rollers, and professional massage for muscle pain and tightness (1:01:30); and</li><li>More.</li></ul>]]>

We talk about the evolutionary origins of the ApoE genotype, with specific attention to the ApoE4 allele and its association with AD. We spend time discussing ApoE4 implications for the brain’s fuel utilization, notably omega-3 fatty acids: EPA and DHA.

        <description>
          <![CDATA[<div>Phil Maffetone is an author, health practitioner, and coach with decades of experience helping everyone from amateurs to world-class athletes optimize their health and performance. In this episode, Phil explains the importance of developing the aerobic system, defines maximum aerobic function (MAF), and explains how to determine your MAF heart rate. He then demonstrates how to integrate that into a training protocol which is designed to help people move faster at a sub maximum heart rate and increase fat utilization as the primary source of fuel—emphasizing the importance of nutrition on one's capacity to oxidize fat. Phil also extracts training insights from the amazing feats of world-class marathoners, explores the impact of a low-carb diet on one’s capacity for high intensity exercise and anaerobic performance, and explains the downstream effects of being “overfat.”<br><br>We discuss:</div><ul><li>Phil’s background in running, and training insights from a six-day race (2:00);</li><li>The difference between being “fit” and being “healthy” (10:30);</li><li>Defining the aerobic and anaerobic systems, and why VO2 max doesn’t predict performance (17:45);</li><li>Defining maximum aerobic function (MAF), determining your MAF heart rate with Phil’s 180 Formula, and why a strong aerobic system is crucial to health and performance (23:30);</li><li>Using the MAF test to track and improve your aerobic fitness (37:00);</li><li>How increasing your sub-max pace at a given heart rate can increase your maximum pace (39:30);</li><li>The impact of nutrition on one’s ability to use fat as fuel while exercising (42:30);</li><li>Phil’s nutritional approach with patients, the concept of “carbohydrate intolerance” (51:15);</li><li>Assessing the impact of a low-carb diet on high intensity exercise and anaerobic performance (57:30);</li><li>Extracting insights from world-class marathoners (1:04:15);</li><li>How being “overfat” affects health and performance, and ways to decrease excess body fat (1:13:00); and</li><li>More.</li></ul>]]>

      <title>#135 - BJ Miller, M.D.: How understanding death leads to a better life</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<p>BJ Miller is a hospice and palliative care specialist on a quest to reframe our relationship with death. In this episode, BJ begins with how his own brush with death radically shifted his perspective and ultimately forged his path towards palliative care and helping patients integrate and understand their life in a meaningful way. BJ recounts several moving stories from his patients, which reveal important lessons about overcoming the fear of death, letting go of regret, and what’s most important in life. He discusses the major design flaws of a “death phobic” healthcare system. Furthermore, he makes the case that seeing death as a part of life allows us to live well, as opposed to living to evade death itself. He concludes with a discussion around physician-assisted death as well as his hopes around the use of psychedelics to reduce suffering in end-of-life care.</p><p>We discuss:</p><ul>
<li>BJ’s accident leading to the loss of his limbs and his experience inside a burn unit [2:30];</li>
<li>Coping with his amputations—being tough, the grieving process, and the healing properties of tears [14:00];</li>
<li>Going from art history to medical school: the value of a diverse background in medicine [27:45];</li>
<li>How BJ’s new body liberated him [39:30];</li>
<li>How losing his sister to suicide and his disillusionment with medicine altered his path [46:45];</li>
<li>Discovering his path of palliative care—distinct from hospice—in medicine [55:00];</li>
<li>Our complicated relationship with death, and how acknowledging it can release its grip and improve living [1:01:45];</li>
<li>The different distinctions around the fear of death, and how BJ helps his patients negotiate fears [1:09:30];</li>
<li>The major design flaws of a “death phobic” healthcare system [1:13:45];</li>
<li>Common regrets, the value of time, and other insights from interactions with patients in their final moments of life [1:22:30];</li>
<li>The story of Randy Sloan—a case study of playing life out [1:33:15];</li>
<li>Physician-assisted dying: Legality and considerations [1:39:15];</li>
<li>The use of psychedelics in end-of-life care, and what BJ is most excited about going forward [1:45:15]; and</li>

        <description>
          <![CDATA[<p>Vinay Prasad is a practicing hematologist-oncologist who doubles as a “meta-researcher,” studying the quality of medical evidence, health policy, and clinical trials. In this episode, Vinay discusses the differences in clinical treatment from the existing medical evidence, often leading to useless, or even harmful, outcomes for patients. With a focus in oncology, he takes a deep dive into the field’s structural problems, which include the disconnect between progress and funding, drug costs, and financial conflicts of interest. He concludes with his “six hallmarks of successful cancer policy” as a potential roadmap to sustained progress against cancer and a way to avoid repeating the policy and practice mistakes of the past.</p><p>We discuss:</p><ul>
<li>Vinay’s background and unique perspective [2:45];</li>
<li>Medical reversal—the disconnect between research findings and clinical applications in medicine [9:45];</li>
<li>The uniquely challenging field of oncology [22:15];</li>
<li>The importance of bedside manner with cancer patients [29:30];</li>
<li>Structural problems in oncology—Problem #1: Huge costs for small improvements [36:30];</li>
<li>Structural problems in oncology—Problem #2: Medical reversal—when medical practices are adopted based on low levels of evidence [39:45];</li>
<li>Structural problems in oncology—Problem #3: Slow progress in cancer research (despite all the hype and propaganda) [44:30];</li>
<li>Structural problems in oncology—Problem #4: The burden of payment is not matched with those making treatment decisions [54:15];</li>
<li>“No-brainer” moves in oncology [1:06:15];</li>

<li>The impact of a patriarchal society, and relational growth as the next step for feminism [18:30];</li>
<li>Origins of deep-rooted shame, and the difference between feeling ashamed and feeling guilty [26:45];</li>
<li>Preventing the propagation of trauma without over-coddling kids [35:00];</li>
<li>The one-up/one-down cycle from grandiosity to shame [37:00];</li>
<li>Covert depression—Steps to fixing the secret legacy of male depression [39:30];</li>
<li>Three forms of false self-esteem [49:30];</li>
<li>Narcissism—A misunderstood concept [51:15];</li>
<li>The interplay of shame, anger, and grandiosity, and how to break the cycle [53:45];</li>

      <title>#113: Normative errors—a conversation with my daughter about current events</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<p>In this episode, I sit down with my daughter to discuss the brutal death of George Floyd, and the aftermath we are watching unfold. Though I have no expertise in race relations, law enforcement, or police brutality, I do have some knowledge in the training of physicians, and it is that training of doctors that I’ve been thinking about lately as it may offer one small insight into this crisis. In this very short discussion, we speak about three types of errors in medicine (and medical training), how to distinguish between the two variants that are acceptable, and the one that is unacceptable. My question, ultimately, is if such a framework can be applied to law enforcement?  </p>]]>

      <title>#112 - Ned David, Ph.D.: How cellular senescence influences aging, and what we can do about it</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<p>Ned David is the co-founder of Unity Biotechnology, a company developing senolytic medicines—molecules that target and destroy senescent cells in the human body. In this episode, Ned explains the science of cellular senescence and how it impacts the aging process. Ned discusses how senolytics may delay, prevent, treat, or even reverse age-related diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disease.

      <title>#110 - Lew Cantley, Ph.D.: Cancer metabolism, cancer therapies, and the discovery of PI3K</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Lew Cantley, Professor of cancer biology and Director of the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center at Weill Cornell Medical College in NYC, walks us through his amazing discovery of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and the implications for the care of patients with cancer. He explains various combinations of therapies being tested and used, including the possibility of pairing prescriptive nutritional therapies to increase the efficacy of drugs like PI3K inhibitors. Lew also explains the metabolic nature of cancer through the lens of his research into the connection between sugar consumption, insulin resistance, and tumor growth. Additionally, Lew provides some details about his exciting new clinical trial that is just now enrolling patients with stage 4 breast cancer and endometrial cancer.</p><p>We discuss:</p><ul>

<li>The metabolic nature of cancer, mitochondria, and a more nuanced explanation of the Warburg Effect [8:00];</li>
<li>The observation that convinced Lew to stop eating sugar [19:45];</li>
<li>The connection between obesity, insulin resistance, and cancer [25:00];</li>
<li>Sugar consumption and tumor growth—What did Lew’s 2019 paper find? [31:30];</li>
<li>Natural sugar vs. HFCS, fruit vs. fruit juice, insulin response and cancer growth [42:30];</li>
<li>Increasing efficacy of PI3K inhibitors with ketogenic diets, SGLT2 inhibitors, and metformin [53:00];</li>
<li>Lew’s clinical trial enrolling stage 4 breast cancer and endometrial cancer patients [1:07:00];</li>
<li>Pairing diet with drug could be the future of cancer treatment [1:09:00];</li>
<li>PI3K inhibitors on the market, alpha vs. delta isoform, and the possibility of pairing them with a food prescription [1:15:45];</li>
<li>What questions will Lew be focused on in the next chapter of his career? [1:21:45];</li>
<li>Lew's early work that ultimately led to the discovery of PI3K [1:27:00];</li>
<li>Studying the mechanism by which mitochondria make ATP [1:30:15];</li>
<li>How understanding the mechanism by which insulin drove glucose uptake into a cell got Lew closer to finding PI3K [1:37:45];</li>
<li>How Lew knew PI3K was important in driving the growth of cancer cells [1:54:30];</li>
<li>Lew’s unlikely observation of phosphorylation at the 3' position of the inositol ring resulting in the formation of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate [1:58:30]; and</li>
<li>More.</li>

      <title>#107 - John Barry: 1918 Spanish flu pandemic—historical account, parallels to today, and lessons</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<p>In this episode, John Barry, historian and author of The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History, describes what happened with the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, including where it likely originated, how and why it spread, and what may have accounted for the occurrence of three separate waves of the virus, each with different rates of infection and mortality. While the current coronavirus pandemic pales in comparison to the devastation of the Spanish flu, John highlights a number of parallels that can be drawn and lessons to be learned and applied going forward.</p><p>We discuss:</p><ul>
<li>What got John interested in the Spanish flu and led to him writing his book? [2:15];</li>
<li>Historical account of the 1918 Spanish flu—origin, the first wave in the summer of 1918, the death rate, and how it compared to other pandemics [10:00];</li>
<li>Evidence that second wave in the fall of 1918 was a mutation of the same virus, and the immunity immunity protection for those exposed to the first wave [17:30];</li>
<li>What impact did World War I have on the spread and the propagation of a “second wave”? [21:15];</li>

          <![CDATA[<p>In this episode, John Barry, historian and author of The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History, describes what happened with the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, including where it likely originated, how and why it spread, and what may have accounted for the occurrence of three separate waves of the virus, each with different rates of infection and mortality. While the current coronavirus pandemic pales in comparison to the devastation of the Spanish flu, John highlights a number of parallels that can be drawn and lessons to be learned and applied going forward.</p><p>We discuss:</p><ul>
<li>What got John interested in the Spanish flu and led to him writing his book? [2:15];</li>
<li>Historical account of the 1918 Spanish flu—origin, the first wave in the summer of 1918, the death rate, and how it compared to other pandemics [10:00];</li>
<li>Evidence that second wave in the fall of 1918 was a mutation of the same virus, and the immunity immunity protection for those exposed to the first wave [17:30];</li>
<li>What impact did World War I have on the spread and the propagation of a “second wave”? [21:15];</li>
<li>How the government’s response may have impacted the death toll [25:45];</li>
<li>Pathology of the Spanish flu, symptoms, time course, transmissibility, mortality, and how it compares to COVID-19 [29:00];</li>
<li>The deadly second wave—The story of Philadelphia and a government and media in cahoots to downplay the truth [35:20];</li>
<li>What role did social distancing and prior exposure to the first wave play in the differing mortality rates city to city? [44:15];</li>
<li>The importance of being truthful with the public—Is honesty the key to reducing fear and panic to bring a community together and combat the socially-isolating nature of pandemic? [45:45];</li>
<li>Third wave of Spanish flu in the spring of 1919 [51:00];</li>
<li>Global impact of Spanish flu, a high mortality in the younger population, and why India hit so much harder than other countries [54:45];</li>

      <title>#106 - Amesh Adalja, M.D.: Comparing COVID-19 to past pandemics, preparing for the future, and reasons for optimism</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<p>In this episode, infectious disease and pandemic preparedness expert, Amesh Adalja, M.D., puts the current pandemic into context against previous coronaviruses as well as past influenza pandemics. Amesh also provides his interpretation of the evolving metrics which have contributed to big variations in modeling predictions, whether this will be a seasonally recurring virus, and perhaps most importantly—how we can be better prepared for the inevitable future novel virus. Finally, Amesh explains where he sees positive trends which give him reasons for optimism.</p><p>We discuss:</p><ul>
<li>Amesh’s background in infectious disease [2:10];</li>
<li>When did the virus actually reach the US? And when did Amesh realize it would pose a real threat to the US? [3:30];</li>
<li>Comparing and contrasting COVID-19 to previous pandemics like the Asian flu of 1958 and the Spanish flu of 1918 [7:30];</li>
<li>Will COVID-19 be a recurring seasonal virus every year? [13:30];</li>
<li>Will a future vaccine be specific to this COVID-19 or will it also cover previous coronaviruses as well? [14:45];</li>
<li>What does Amesh think might be the true case fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2? [15:45];</li>
<li>Why did early models over predict infections and deaths by order of millions? [18:00];</li>
<li>Role of government—How does Amesh view the role of local versus central government in dealing with a future pandemic? [21:20];</li>
<li>What went wrong with testing and how could we have utilized it more effectively? [24:45];</li>
<li>Future pandemic preparedness—why Amesh is cautiously optimistic [27:00];</li>
<li>Should there be different policies and restrictions for places like New York City compared to less populated and less affected places across the US? [29:45];</li>
<li>Why mass gatherings might be disproportionately driving the spread of the virus [32:00];</li>
<li>Learning from HKU1, a lesser-known novel coronavirus from 2005 [33:30];</li>
<li>Thoughts on Sweden’s herd immunity approach [35:40];</li>
<li>The efficacy of masks being worn in public and what role they will play as restrictions are slowly lifted [36:50];</li>
<li>What are some positive trends and signs of optimism? [38:45]; and</li>

        <description>
          <![CDATA[<p>In this episode, psychiatrist Paul Conti, M.D. discusses the impact of the fear and uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting stress, anxiety, and trauma it may impart on the population. Paul examines how this situation has highlighted the challenges we face at the societal level as well as the individual level, and stresses the importance of seeking absolute truth above personal truth and taking action as individuals as a means to combat many of these pervasive problems.</p><p>We discuss:</p><ul>
<li>Paul’s personal experience with a presumptive case of COVID-19 [1:45];</li>
<li>Through the lens of trauma, Paul’s overall take on the lasting effects of this pandemic on society [4:00];</li>
<li>The imperative to unite as a species given the isolating and suspicious nature of an invisible enemy [7:45];</li>
<li>The indigent population and the affluent population—The commonalities and differences in how both populations have been affected [15:45];</li>
<li>The prevailing feeling of demoralization spanning the population [25:00];</li>
<li>Health care workers—What lingering psychological effects might they suffer from this? [34:30];</li>
<li>Could this pandemic be a catalyst for changing the way people think about science, truth, and logic? [46:00];</li>
<li>How our inability to deal with uncertainty exacerbates the problem, and the need for humility [57:30];</li>
<li>What has been Paul’s recipe for self care during this time? [1:06:15];</li>
<li>The forthcoming challenge of reintegrating back into the world when the quarantines lift [1:14:15];</li>

      <title>#102 - Michael Osterholm, Ph.D.: COVID-19—Lessons learned, challenges ahead, and reasons for optimism and concern</title>
        <description>

Dr. Hotez informs us about the current state of disease progression, which has many unknowns, but has thus far been greatly determined by the delayed response time and lack of testing. Moreover, we discuss what we can do on a country, state, community, and individual level in order to collectively slow transmission of the disease.

      <title>#96 - David Epstein: How a range of experience leads to better performance in a highly specialized world</title>
        <description>

      <title>#94 - Mark Hyman, M.D.: The impact of the food system on our health and the environment</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Mark Hyman, M.D., director of the Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional Medicine and the author of Food Fix, discusses that if we can fix the food system, we can solve many big problems—namely the chronic disease/obesity epidemic, the rising costs of healthcare, as well as the big problems facing the environment. Mark first briefly lays out the health consequences of processed food with a focus on the gut microbiome. From there, Mark discusses the environmental consequences of industrial farming and lays out how we can affect change on the individual level, through policy and regulations, and perhaps most importantly through regenerative agriculture. Additionally, Mark talks about the potential health risks of consuming GMO foods, herbicides, and other chemicals used in industrial farming as well as the environmental consequences, such as the loss of soil, caused by those same fertilizers and methods of farming.</p><p>We discuss:</p><ul>
<li>The negative consequences of the existing food environment [3:00];</li>
<li>What makes processed food so unhealthy? [8:30];</li>
<li>The gut microbiome: Inflammation from gut permeability and how to measure gut health [18:00];</li>
<li>Steps to fixing a bad gut—The Five R’s [24:00];</li>
<li>Some staggering health statistics, and which races might be more genetically susceptible [26:45];</li>
<li>An argument for government regulations and policies to fight back against a massive food industry with unlimited resources (and what we can learn from the tobacco story) [28:30];</li>
<li>Industrial farming and climate change: The degradation of soil and use of fertilizer [41:15];</li>
<li>Regenerative agriculture: Could it be the answer to food waste, our health problems, and the environment? [51:15];</li>
<li>Comparing the Impossible Burger to regeneratively raised beef [1:05:30];</li>
<li>GMO and Roundup—The potential health risks of consuming GMO foods sprayed with Roundup (glyphosate) and other herbicides and pesticides [1:07:45];</li>
<li>How the livelihood of farmers are being affected by big ag companies and the current industrial farming system [1:16:00];</li>
<li>The loss of biodiversity in our food, and what “organic” really means [1:18:30];</li>
<li>What can people do on the individual level to protect themselves as well as affect change to the toxic food system? [1:24:30];</li>
<li>What role does the USDA play in this “toxic” food environment and how do we fix it? [1:29:45];</li>
<li>The top 3 changes Mark would make if he was “food czar” [1:34:45];</li>
<li>Mark’s rebuttal against the argument that it’s best for the environment if we stop farming animals and move to a fully plant-based diet (and his argument for “agriculture 2.0") [1:36:00];</li>
<li>What is Mark’s overall mission with the work that he’s doing? [1:40:00];</li>
<li>Bread in the US vs. Europe: Why does bread (and wheat products) taste different and potentially cause less health problems in Europe versus the US? [1:41:30]; and</li>
<li>More.</li>

      <title>#88 - Paul Grewal, M.D.: Treating metabolic disease and strategies for long-term health</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Paul Grewal, internal medicine physician and co-author of Genius Foods, discusses what has got him so focused on lifestyle changes for metabolic health which was partly brought on by his own experience of losing almost 100 pounds at two points in his life. Paul and Peter discuss how the results from a NuSI-funded study has impacted their feelings about the supposed “metabolic advantage” of a low-carb diet. Paul then makes the case for what he calls the “active poisoning” of the American food supply, defines his five phenotypes of obesity manifestation, as well as lays out his nutritional and training approach with his patients (as well as himself personally). Overall, this discussion is a treasure trove of topics from endocrinology, insulin resistance, caloric restriction, fasting, exercise, causes of obesity, LDL and heart disease, and much more.</p><p>We discuss:</p><ul>
<li>Paul’s health story—two instances of major weight loss [2:45];</li>
<li>The multiplication of adipocytes after weight loss, and why an obese adult that was overweight in childhood is harder to treat than adult-onset obesity [7:00];</li>
<li>Low-carb diets—Is there a metabolic advantage in energy expenditure? (And Peter’s take on the NUSI study) [12:15];</li>
<li>The relationship between hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia—which is causing which? [26:30];</li>
<li>Weight gain—Which macronutrients are driving it, processed foods, and overfeeding studies [30:45];</li>
<li>The active poisoning of our food supply with processed foods [35:45];</li>
<li>The role of fructose in metabolic disease and NAFLD [38:30];</li>
<li>Where traditional medicine falls short in the real world and why “functional medicine” is gaining steam [45:15];</li>
<li>Relationship between heart disease and LDL, residual risk, LDL clearance problem, and a patient case study [53:30];</li>
<li>Relationship between heart disease and fatty acids (SFA, PUFA, seed oils, etc.) [1:04:00];</li>
<li>Paul’s nutritional approach with patients [1:12:00];</li>
<li>High-carb/low-fat diet for muscle gain, and the “reverse diet” to combat the slowdown of metabolism after caloric restriction/weight loss [1:14:30];</li>
<li>Fasting—ideal duration, how to preserve muscle mass, and the ultimate tool of medicine [1:23:00];</li>
<li>The 5 phenotypes of obesity, and the impact of carbs, cortisol, and sleep on adiposity [1:28:00];</li>
<li>Uric acid [1:37:45];</li>
<li>Paul’s 2nd big physical transformation—How he did it and kept the weight off [1:38:45];</li>

      <title>#87 - Rick Johnson, M.D.: Fructose—The common link in high blood pressure, insulin resistance, T2D, &amp; obesity?</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Rick Johnson, Professor of Nephrology at the University of Colorado, explains how his research into the causes of blood pressure resulted in a change of research direction to focus more on how fructose has such profound metabolic effects. Rick discusses the relationship between salt and high blood pressure, provides a masterclass into uric acid, and expertly reveals the mechanisms and pathways by which sugar (specifically fructose) can profoundly impact metabolic health. From there, he explains how he applies this information to real life patients, as well as touches on some of the most promising ideas around pharmacotherapy that are being developed in response to the epidemics of fatty liver, insulin resistance, diabetes, and obesity. Furthermore, Rick gives his take on artificial sweeteners compared to real sugar, discusses cancer’s affinity for fructose, and much more.</p><p>We discuss:</p><ul>
<li>The connection between blood pressure and fructose that shifted Rick’s professional focus [3:30];</li>
<li>The relationship between salt and blood pressure (and the role of sugar) [5:15];</li>
<li>Defining fructose, glucose, and sugar [19:00];</li>
<li>An ancient mutation in apes that explains why humans turn fructose into fat so easily [22:00];</li>
<li>The problems with elevated uric acid levels, and what it tells us about how sugar causes disease [31:00];</li>
<li>How sugar causes obesity—explaining the difference in glucose vs. fructose metabolism and the critical pathway induced by fructose [39:30];</li>
<li>Why drinking sugar is worse than eating it [49:30];</li>
<li>Unique ability of sugar to drive oxidative stress to the mitochondria, insulin resistance, and diabetes [53:30];</li>
<li>Why cancer loves fructose [59:45];</li>
<li>The many areas of the body that can use fructose [1:04:30];</li>
<li>Fructokinase inhibitors—a potential blockbuster? [1:06:45];</li>
<li>Treating high uric acid levels—Rick’s approach with patients [1:09:30];</li>
<li>Salt intake—what advice does Rick give his patients? [1:16:00];</li>
<li>How excess glucose (i.e., high carb diets) can cause problems even in the absence of fructose [1:20:30];</li>
<li>Artificial sweeteners vs. real sugar—which is better? [1:28:45];</li>
<li>Umami, MSG, alcohol, beer—do these have a role in metabolic illness? [1:33:15];</li>

<li>Breaking down the conversion process of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids including how we get to EPA and DHA [24:30]; </li>
<li>Takeaway from Bill’s 1980 study looking at how salmon oil affected cholesterol and triglyceride levels [32:45];</li>
<li>History of our understanding of omega-3 and its effect on LDL cholesterol [41:30];</li>
<li>Prescribed fish oil drugs vs. OTC supplements—Differences and recommended brands [48:30];</li>

      <title>#81 - Debra Kimless, M.D. &amp; Steve Goldner, J.D.: Cannabis – the latest science on CBD &amp; THC</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Dr. Debra Kimless and Steve Goldner share their knowledge on the science, policy, and market evolution of medicinal cannabis. We start with the differences between THC and CBD, how they work in the body, and how they act on the brain. We discuss the many potential benefits of using CBD, THC, hemp in the various forms of administration (smoking, vaping, edibles, oils, etc.) as well as some of the safety issues including the recent uptick in incidents of hospitalization and death linked to vaping. Debra and Steve are both involved with the company, Pure Green—Debra the Chief Medical Officer and Steve the founder and CEO—whose aim is to create the safest, most efficacious form of delivery of cannabis. Their bigger mission is to shift the perception of the cannabis plant, garner acceptance of its medicinal benefits, and ultimately get it descheduled on a federal level so more people can access cannabis for a range of chronic ailments.</p><p>We discuss:</p><ul>
<li>Debra and Steve’s background reason for their interest in medical cannabis [3:30];</li>
<li>The history of medical use of cannabis [7:45];</li>
<li>How THC, CBD, and other cannabinoids work [12:30];</li>
<li>Hemp—What it is, special uses, and the 2018 farm bill [19:15];</li>

<li>Dealing with the disappointment of “losing the gold” [37:00];</li>
<li>The tiny window of opportunity for Olympians, and the overwhelming pressure to meet expectations [46:00];</li>
<li>Sasha’s unique childhood, finding figure skating, and channeling her hyperactive personality into becoming an amazing skater [58:00];</li>
<li>The consequences of extreme training at a young age, and trying to control the uncontrollable [1:06:30];</li>
<li>What is driving extreme athletes and Olympians to be the best? [1:15:00];</li>
<li>Why many former Olympians and athletes struggle with depression [1:21:30];</li>

        <description>
          <![CDATA[<div>In this episode, Kyle Kingsbury, retired UFC fighter and director of human optimization at Onnit, discusses the purpose and meaning that football and MMA gave him but which also acted as a distraction from his inner demons. Kyle opens up about his use of PEDs (steroids, testosterone, HGH) in college and talks about some of the misconceptions around them. Next, Kyle talks about his battle with depression and a close call with suicide that lead to life-changing experiences with psilocybin and ayahuasca—which really became the turning point in his own journey towards being more emotionally healthy, finding inner peace, and being a better husband and father. </div><div>

      <title>#75 - David Light: Zantac recall due to cancer concerns – what you need to know</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<div>In this episode, David Light, CEO of Valisure (the company which alerted the FDA to the Zantac cancer concerns), explains the story behind the recent recalls by manufacturers of ranitidine, a common heartburn medication, sold under the trade name Zantac, due to a potential link to increased cancer risk. David breaks down all the evidence, the role of his unique pharmacy company which tests all its drugs before being dispensed to consumers, and the reason behind the FDA’s tempered reaction to the alarming study results. David makes the argument that Zantac/ranitidine is an inherently unstable molecule which explains the grossly excessive amounts of NDMA (a probable human carcinogen) as opposed to just a contamination for which there could be numerous causes. Finally, David and Peter both provide recommendations for what to do if you or someone you know is currently taking Zantac/ranitidine.<br><br>We discuss:</div><ul>
<li>The impetus for starting Valisure, a unique online pharmacy that tests all its medications [3:30];</li>
<li>The story behind the recall of valsartan, and the role which Valisure played [21:00];</li>
<li>Testing Zantac: The shocking results from Valisure’s initial testing with major potential cancer implications [32:30];</li>
<li>NDMA - the probable human carcinogen found in Zantac/ranitidine [45:15];</li>
<li>The epidemiology question: Are we inferring too much from epidemiology? What can we take away from the existing studies? [50:00];</li>
<li>The staggering results from the 2016 Stanford study, why it didn’t alarm more people, and how Valisure found the missing biological link [58:00];</li>
<li>Alerting the FDA, the FDA’s tempered response, and question of contamination vs. inherent instability [1:04:00];</li>
<li>How confident is David that the elevated levels of NDMA being found in ranitidine are not due to instrumentation, human error, or temperature contamination? [1:20:45];</li>
<li>The massive risk being taken by the FDA by not doing more to keep ranitidine away from consumers [1:21:45];</li>
<li>If someone is taking Zantac/ranitidine, what should they do? What else do they need to know? [1:24:15]; and</li>

      <title>#74 – Jason Fried: Optimizing efficiency and work-life balance</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<div>In this episode, Jason Fried, co-founder of Basecamp, shares his beliefs around achieving business success in a modern world which tends to disproportionately focus on the massive success stories (the outliers). Jason gives his honest take on companies like WeWork, Uber, and Lyft that may give off the appearance of wild success but may instead provide an example of the dangers of perverse incentives. We get into Jason’s backstory, and how his affinity for optimizing efficiency and production in the workplace culminated with the creation of Basecamp, his very successful web-based project management software business. Perhaps most importantly, we get really deep into all aspects of work-life balance and what it really means to “work hard” (Stay tuned for an AMA-style deep dive into the topic of work-life balance with Jason in the near future). In addition, Jason provides many more valuable nuggets including thoughts on some common mistakes made by businesses today, the value of giving employees autonomy, how to take the right types of risks, why he doesn’t set any goals, and much, much more.<br><br>We discuss:<br><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Jason’s background and his early entrepreneurial spirit [6:15];</li>
<li>Views on completing higher education and the notion of hard work [20:30];</li>
<li>Beliefs around success in business [31:30];</li>
<li>WeWork, Uber, and Lyft: Poor business practices and the dangers of perverse incentives [38:00];</li>
<li>Jason’s early career: his redesign approach and personal motivation [52:30];</li>
<li>The genesis of Basecamp [1:06:30];</li>
<li>Why Jason does not set goals but instead focuses on a vision [1:08:45];</li>
<li>Workplace motivation and hiring practice [1:17:00];</li>
<li>The importance of luck and not overworking [1:28:30];</li>
<li>A framework to work less and optimize for workplace autonomy [1:34:30];</li>
<li>The importance of saying ‘no’ more often (and tips for doing so) [1:51:30];</li>
<li>A shared passion for watches [2:00:00];</li>
<li>Guarding against the perils of phone addiction [2:05:15];</li>

      <title>#72 - Dan Harris: 10% happier – meditation, kindness, and compassion</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<div>In this episode, Dan Harris, correspondent for ABC News and co-founder of the Ten Percent Happier meditation app, speaks openly about his struggles with self-centeredness, addiction, depression, emotional volatility, and the deep-rooted insecurities that drove him to career success. He tells the story of how a panic attack on live TV lead him down a path of self-discovery culminating in a meditation practice which has since transformed his life—in terms of his own personal suffering, his relationships with those closest to him, and his ability to be kind and compassionate (which has its own selfish advantages). Dan also shares some very practical advice and tips for new meditators, dispels some of the myths around meditation, and gives people some things to look forward to as they progress with their practice. Last but not least, we talk about the importance of not passing shame and trauma to our kids and the role that mindfulness and meditation plays in that.<br><br>We discuss:</div><ul>
<li>Dan’s meditation book, and the panic attack on live TV that started it all [4:45];</li>
<li>Addiction: the spectrum of addiction, the socially acceptable forms, and Dan’s own battle with addiction and depression [10:00];</li>
<li>Dan’s drive for self-protection, a defining moment of childhood, and how his upbringing shaped him [17:00];</li>
<li>A selfish reason to be kind and compassionate [25:00];</li>

          <![CDATA[<div>In this episode, Dan Harris, correspondent for ABC News and co-founder of the Ten Percent Happier meditation app, speaks openly about his struggles with self-centeredness, addiction, depression, emotional volatility, and the deep-rooted insecurities that drove him to career success. He tells the story of how a panic attack on live TV lead him down a path of self-discovery culminating in a meditation practice which has since transformed his life—in terms of his own personal suffering, his relationships with those closest to him, and his ability to be kind and compassionate (which has its own selfish advantages). Dan also shares some very practical advice and tips for new meditators, dispels some of the myths around meditation, and gives people some things to look forward to as they progress with their practice. Last but not least, we talk about the importance of not passing shame and trauma to our kids and the role that mindfulness and meditation plays in that.<br><br>We discuss:</div><ul>

        <description>
          <![CDATA[<div>In this episode, Katherine Eban, investigative journalist and author of Bottle of Lies, illuminates the prevalence of fraud in generic drug manufacturing which brings into question the idea that generics are identical to brand-name drug as we are lead to believe. Katherine walks us through how this widespread corruption came to be, including the shocking story of one particularly egregious (and unfortunately not uncommon) example of an Indian drug company, Ranbaxy, whose business model was completely dependent on falsifying data in their drug applications to the FDA. We then discuss the subsequent investigation into Indian and Chinese drug manufacturing plants which revealed that nearly 80% of them are tainted with fraud. We conclude this discussion on a positive note with i) how individuals can investigate their own drugs to protect themselves ii) an innovative pharmacy attempting to disrupt the market and iii) some ideas on how to reform to the regulations around generic drugs, the FDA, and more. </div><div><br></div><div>We discuss:<br><br>

      <title>#70 - David Sinclair, Ph.D.: How cellular reprogramming could slow our aging clock (and the latest research on NAD)</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<div>In this episode, David Sinclair, Ph.D., a Professor in the Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and co-Director of the Paul F. Glenn Center for the Biological Mechanisms of Aging, returns to the podcast to discuss the content of his new book, Lifespan: Why We Age - and Why We Don’t Have To. This conversation focuses on the biological mechanisms involved in what David terms the Information Theory of Aging which provides insights into the “clock” that determines our aging and to what degree it can be manipulated. Our discussion on aging of course leads us into interconnected topics of epigenetics, sirtuins, cellular senescence, as well as what compounds David is personally taking for his own longevity. Additionally, we discuss the most up to date information related to NAD and longevity by looking at the potential benefits (if any) of supplemental agents (NAD precursors, NR, NMR, etc.) that pose a promise of increasing NAD.<br><br>

      <title>#68 - Marty Makary, M.D.: The US healthcare system—why it’s broken, steps to fix it, and how to protect yourself</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<div>In this episode, Dr. Marty Makary, Johns Hopkins surgeon and NYT bestselling author, discusses his ambitious attempt to fix the broken U.S. healthcare system through educating the public, changing the lexicon, encouraging radical transparency in pricing, and more.

      <title>#65 - Rick Doblin, Ph.D.: MDMA— the creation, scheduling, toxicity, therapeutic use, and changing public opinion of what is possibly the single most important synthetic molecule ever created by our species</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<div>In this episode, Rick Doblin, founder and executive director of MAPS, discusses MDMA, a molecule that has (at a minimum) revolutionary therapeutic benefits for PTSD, but arguably could have, at the highest order, a lasting impact on humanity’s ability to peacefully coexist. Rick details the history of MDMA, what lead to its unfortunate criminalization, and his lifelong work trying to protect MDMA (and other psychedelics) from criminalization (and his subsequent attempt to decriminalize it). Through his founding of MAPS, Rick has made enormous progress in debunking many of the exaggerated risks being claimed against MDMA (neurotoxicity, memory loss, depression, Parkinson’s, etc.), and is very close to getting FDA approval for a psychotherapy technique using MDMA. Additionally in this discussion, you will learn about the history of LSD, psilocybin, and other psychedelics and how the combination of the misunderstanding of them with the crackdown on drug use in the 1970s lead to their designation of schedule 1 substances. But it’s important to note that you will also realize from this discussion just how different MDMA is compared to the average psychedelic. We end this discussion with a message of hope: there are going to be many people who are going to wonder what can they do to receive this MDMA therapy. We talk about what those clinical trials look like, what the enrollment looks like, and perhaps more importantly, what a compassionate use license would look like, such that if there are patients who are in need of this therapy (prior to its approval) they can have an understanding of the legal paths to doing just that. </div><div> </div><div>We discuss:</div><ul>
<li>Discovering MDMA, how Rick learned about it and his first experiences with it [6:15];</li>
<li>The timeline of MDMA’s evolution, the reinvention in the 1970s, “ecstasy”, the criminalization of MDMA [17:40];</li>
<li>Explaining the different “schedules” of drugs [27:25];</li>
<li>Rick’s fight to protect it for therapeutic uses, losing to the DEA despite winning in the court, the scientific community, and the media [34:55];</li>
<li>The risks involved with taking MDMA [39:00];</li>
<li>An incredible MDMA-LSD case study: Rick’s story of healing a treatment-resistant PTSD patient in the 1980s [41:15];</li>
<li>How and why MDMA was declared illegal on an emergency basis going against the judge’s recommendation after hearing Rick’s compelling case (and multiple appeals) in court [53:45];</li>
<li>Rick’s decision to study politics to affect change from the inside out, and the recent progress being made with the DEA [1:03:30];</li>
<li>Debunking the exaggerated risks of MDMA (e.g., neurotoxicity) [1:13:00];</li>
<li>Rick’s unbelievable ability to play the long game [1:25:15];</li>
<li>Which patients would not be good candidates for MDMA from a safety perspective? [1:31:00];</li>
<li>How MDMA is different from all other psychedelics, the importance of the setting, and Peter’s experiences with MDMA [1:33:00];</li>
<li>MDMA studies which lead to the crucial designation as a “breakthrough therapy” [1:37:00];</li>
<li>How someone with PTSD can get treated now through “expanded access for compassionate use” [1:42:30];</li>
<li>Rick’s ultimate goal and long term vision for psychedelic clinics [1:47:00];</li>
<li>Trip of Compassion documentary, and how psychedelics could change the world [1:49:00];</li>
<li>Rick’s early life: Resisting the draft, his feeling of wanting to change the world, and his profound experiences with LSD and other psychedelics [1:52:00];</li>
<li>The history of LSD and psilocybin, and the CIA’s interest in psychedelics [2:07:15];</li>
<li>Timothy Leary and the Good Friday Experiment [2:18:30];</li>
<li>Rick’s follow up study to the Good Friday Experiment, and his criticism (and praise) of Tim Leary [2:30:20];</li>
<li>Peter’s experience taking psilocybin [2:41:00];</li>
<li>The Concord Prison Experiment, and Rick’s follow up study 34 years later [2:43:30]; and</li>
<li>More.</li>

      <title>#64 - Zol Kryger, M.D.: Navigating the sometimes shady world of plastic surgery—understanding potential complications of common procedures and how to reduce your risk by choosing the right doctor and asking the right questions.</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<div>In this episode, board certified plastic surgeon, Zol Kryger, enlightens us about the frighteningly loose laws regulating the industry of plastic surgery, paving the way for a majority of cosmetic procedures being performed by doctors that are not board certified plastic surgeons. We talk about some of the very serious complications that can occur even in “minimally invasive” procedures, where the incidence rate is only increased by the flood of non-certified doctors who want to offer these procedures to augment their income. Fortunately, Zol provides listeners with a very specific list of important questions to ask a surgeon when considering any of the many cosmetic procedures available. We then go into the specifics of the most common procedures and the risk of complications for each of them, including breast augmentation, tummy tucks, liposuction, Brazilian butt lifts, botox and fillers, facial peels and lasers, and more. By the end of this episode, you'll have a really clear understanding of what these risks are and how you can go about reducing those risks by choosing the right physician.</div><div>
<br>We discuss:<br><br><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Why Zol chose plastic surgery [4:00];</li>
<li>The shockingly high percentage of plastic surgery being done by non-board certified doctors, and the laws that allow it to happen [7:50];</li>
<li>10 Questions to Ask Your Cosmetic Surgeon (PDF Download) [17:30];</li>
<li>Complications: Why you must ask your doctor about potential complications and how they would deal with them [20:50];</li>
<li>Zol’s first complication, how he dealt with it, and how having a partner to check your work is great for the doctor and patient [29:00];</li>
<li>Breast augmentation: What you need to know—types of implants, complication rates, and Zol’s summary of the safest and most effective way to do it [35:40];</li>
<li>Breast reconstruction following a mastectomy [1:03:00];</li>
<li>Tummy tuck: How it’s done, biggest risks involved, scarring, and how it can address hernias and diastasis [1:09:30];</li>
<li>Liposuction: How it works, the potential complications and risks involved, and the importance of choosing the right doctor in the “wild west” of liposuction [1:23:15];</li>
<li>Butt lifts: Rising popularity, major risks, the frighteningly loose laws regulating the industry, and how the butt lift industry is eerily similar to the subprime mortgage crisis [1:33:30];</li>
<li>What is it about plastic surgery (and not other segments of medicine) that compels (and allows for) untrained doctors to offer these procedures? [1:46:15];</li>
<li>Peter asks Zol if he ever feels emotionally conflicted working in an industry that sometimes can feed off the vanity and insecurity of people [1:52:55];</li>
<li>Does Zol ever turn down patients? [1:59:15];</li>
<li>The risks involved with botox, fillers, facial peels, and laser treatments [2:04:15]; and</li>

      <title>#61 - Rajpaul Attariwala, M.D., Ph.D.: Cancer screening with full-body MRI scans and a seminar on the field of radiology</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<div>In this episode, radiologist/engineer, Raj Attariwala, explains how he was able to apply his engineering background to create a unique MRI scanner that is capable of constructing whole-body images with a resolution that is unmatched in the industry. Peter and Raj discuss the implications of such a robust, radiation-free imaging tool on the early detection of cancer. They dive deep into cancer screening and define terms such as sensitivity and specificity that are necessary to really understand this complex space. They then describe the biggest risks involved in this type of screening (false positives) and how Raj’s unique technology and process might drive down this risk substantially. But before that, they discuss all the common imaging technology from X-ray, to CT scan, to PET scans, to ultrasound, to MRI, and more. They touch on the history of each, how they work, the usefulness and limitations of each of them, as well as the varying risks involved such as radiation exposure. If you are interested in cancer screening and/or you’ve ever wondered how any radiology tool works, this episode is for you.</div><div><br></div><div>We discuss:<br><br><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Raj’s road from engineering to radiology [4:15];</li>
<li>How X-ray works, the risk of radiation exposure, and the varying amounts of radiation associated with the different imaging technologies [14:30];</li>
<li>Computed tomography scans (CT scans): The history of CT, how it works, and why we use contrast [24:15];</li>
<li>Ultrasound: Benefits and limitations, and a special use for the heart [37:15];</li>
<li>Detecting breast cancer with mammography: When is works, when you need more testing, and defining ‘sensitivity’ and ‘specificity’ [47:45];</li>
<li>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): How it works, defining terms, and looking at the most common types of MRI [1:00:15];</li>
<li>Brain aneurysms: Using MRI to find them and save lives [1:20:15];</li>
<li>Raj’s unique MRI technology [1:26:30];</li>
<li>The risk of false positives in cancer detection, and how Raj’s MRI can reduce the number of false positives (i.e., increase specificity) [1:40:10];</li>
<li>The unique software Raj created to pair with his MRI machine [1:47:45];</li>
<li>Comparing the radiation exposure of a whole-body PET-CT to Raj’s equipment (DWIBS-MRI) [1:50:10];</li>

          <![CDATA[<div>In this episode, radiologist/engineer, Raj Attariwala, explains how he was able to apply his engineering background to create a unique MRI scanner that is capable of constructing whole-body images with a resolution that is unmatched in the industry. Peter and Raj discuss the implications of such a robust, radiation-free imaging tool on the early detection of cancer. They dive deep into cancer screening and define terms such as sensitivity and specificity that are necessary to really understand this complex space. They then describe the biggest risks involved in this type of screening (false positives) and how Raj’s unique technology and process might drive down this risk substantially. But before that, they discuss all the common imaging technology from X-ray, to CT scan, to PET scans, to ultrasound, to MRI, and more. They touch on the history of each, how they work, the usefulness and limitations of each of them, as well as the varying risks involved such as radiation exposure. If you are interested in cancer screening and/or you’ve ever wondered how any radiology tool works, this episode is for you.</div><div><br></div><div>We discuss:<br><br><br>

      <title>#60 - Annie Duke, decision strategist: Poker as a model system for life—how to improve decision making, use frameworks for learning, and apply ‘backcasting’ to boost your odds for future success</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<div>In this episode, former World Series of Poker champion and author, Annie Duke, explains how poker is a pertinent model system for decision making in the real world, a system which blends imperfect information with some unknown percentage of both luck and skill. We go through the decision-making matrix, and how we spend most of our energy focusing on just one of the four quadrants at the expense of the learning opportunities that come from the other 75% of situations. Annie also shares how this evaluation of only the bad outcomes (and our tendency to judge others more harshly than ourselves in the face of a non-status quo decision), leads individuals, leaders, and teams to avoid bad outcomes at all costs. This avoidance is at the cost of the types of decisions which lead to progress and innovation both personally, and societally, across many realms from poker to sports to business to medicine. We also dive deep into a framework for learning, and the levels of thought required to rise to the top of a given domain. Finally, we talk about something that resonated deeply with me in terms of how I think about extending healthspan, which is the concept of “backcasting.”</div><div><br></div><div>We discuss:<br><br><br><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Annie’s background, favorite sports teams, and Peter’s affinity for Belichick [4:00];</li>
<li>Chess vs. poker: Which is a better metaphor for decision making in life (and medicine)? [9:00];</li>
<li>Thinking probabilistically: Why we aren’t wired that way, and how you can improve it for better decision making [14:45];</li>
<li>Variable reinforcement: The psychological draw of poker that keeps people playing [21:45];</li>
<li>The role of luck and skill in poker (and other sports), and the difference between looking at the short run vs. long run [34:30];</li>
<li>A brief explanation of Texas hold ‘em [43:30];</li>
<li>The added complexity of reading the behavior of others players in poker [49:45];</li>
<li>Why Annie likes to “quit fast”, and why poker is still popular despite the power of loss aversion [55:00];</li>
<li>Limit vs. no limit poker, and how the game has changed with growing popularity [57:30];</li>
<li>The advent of analytics to poker, and why Annie would get crushed against today’s professionals [1:7:00];</li>
<li>The decision matrix, and the ‘resulting’ heuristic: The simplifier we use to judge the quality of decisions —The Pete Carroll Superbowl play call example [1:13:00];</li>
<li>The personal and societal consequences of avoiding bad outcomes [1:23:30];</li>
<li>Poker as a model system for life [1:33:45];</li>
<li>How many leaders are making (and encouraging) status-quo decisions, and how Bill Belichick’s decision making changed after winning two Super Bowls [1:37:30];</li>
<li>What did we learn about decision making from the Y2K nothingburger? And how about the D-Day invasion? [1:43:00];</li>
<li>The first step to becoming a good decision maker [1:45:15];</li>
<li>The difference between elite poker players and the ones who make much slower progress [1:52:00];</li>
<li>Framework for learning a skill, the four levels of thought, and why we hate digging into our victories to see what happened [1:54:45];</li>
<li>The capacity for self-deception, and when it is MOST important to apply four-level thinking [2:02:45];</li>
<li>Soft landings: The challenge of high-level thinking where there is subtle feedback and wider skill gaps [2:13:15];</li>
<li>The benefits of ‘backcasting’ (and doing pre-mortems) [2:16:00];</li>

      <title>#59 - Jason Fung, M.D.: Fasting as a potent antidote to obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and the many symptoms of metabolic illness</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<div>In this episode, Jason Fung, nephrologist and best-selling author, shares his experiences utilizing an individualized approach to fasting to successfully treat thousands of overweight, metabolically ill, and diabetic patients, and why being a doctor who specializes in kidney disease gives him a unique insight into early indications of metabolic disease. We also have a great discussion on insulin resistance where Jason makes the case that we should actually think of hyperinsulinemia as the underlying problem. We also discuss the difference between time-restricted feeding, intermittent fasting, and dietary restriction (e.g., low-carb) and how they can be used to attack the root cause of T2D, metabolic syndrome, and obesity. We also have a fascinating discussion about the limitations of evidence-based medicine which leads to a conversation where we compare and contrast the scientific disciplines of medicine and biology to theoretical physics. <br><br><br>

      <title>#52 – Ethan Weiss, M.D.: A masterclass in cardiovascular disease and growth hormone – two topics that are surprising interrelated</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<div>In this episode, Ethan Weiss, Hopkins trained preventative cardiologist at UCSF, discusses two topics that on the surface may seem unrelated which is cardiovascular disease, and the role of growth hormone and IGF in disease. Ethan provides a masterclass in everything from acute coronary syndrome to all of the complex nuances around stent placement, as well as how calcium scores and results from CT angiograms shape his treatment of patients. He also shares how his idea to study the sex differences in blood clotting as it relates to coronary disease lead him to pursue the field of endocrinology, and specifically what he found with respect to the effect of growth hormone and IGF on the liver, the brain, and overall human longevity.<br><br><br>

<li>Defining coronary disease and myocardial infarction: The evolving nomenclature [28:30];</li>
<li>What happens when someone comes to the ER with a STEMI (ST elevation myocardial infarction)? [43:45];</li>
<li>Stents [51:15];</li>
<li>Treatment protocol for both acute and chronic coronary artery disease: History, controversy, and important distinctions [1:03:00];</li>
<li>Using stents to treat stable angina: What we learned from the COURAGE AND ORBITA trials [1:12:00];</li>
<li>The “art” of longevity: The challenge of preventative medicine and understanding risk [1:28:15];</li>
<li>Understanding CAC scores, and CT angiogram results [1:36:45];</li>
<li>How sex differences in clotting and heart disease got Ethan interested in growth hormone and IGF [1:57:30];</li>
<li>Impact of growth hormone on the liver [2:03:30];</li>
<li>Growth hormone and insulin sensitivity [2:14:30];</li>

      <title>#51 – Robert Sapolsky, Ph.D.: The pervasive effect of stress – is it killing you?</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<div>In this episode, Robert Sapolsky, Ph.D., discusses the widespread impact of stress on our physical and emotional health as well as the mechanisms by which it can precipitate chronic illness, dementia, depression, and more. He also provides insight into the factors that contribute to the stress response (and our ability to handle it) such as social rank, personality, environment, and genetics. Lastly, we discuss how our behavior is altered in the face of stress and how that not only has a pervasive effect on a personal level, but also on society as a whole in how we interact with each other.<br><br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>We discuss:<br></strong><br><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Background, interest in stress, and Robert’s time in Kenya studying baboons [3:30];</li>
<li>Physiology of a stress response, and why it’s ingrained in our DNA [10:30];</li>
<li>Individual variation in the response to stress, and how everyone has a different optimal level [20:30];</li>
<li>How social rank and personality differences affect our stress response [26:45];</li>
<li>What’s happening in the brain when faced with stressful situations? [35:45];</li>
<li>What makes the human brain different than all other species? [44:45];</li>
<li>Imprinting stress to your kids epigenetically [48:30];</li>
<li>The role of stress on memory and the consequences of hypercortisolemia [53:45];</li>
<li>The impact of subjective socioeconomic status and social media on stress levels and health [58:15];</li>
<li>Tips for managing stress in the modern world [1:14:15];</li>
<li>What Robert learned about himself studying the social behavior of baboons [1:26:00];</li>
<li>The multilayered factors behind every human behavior, the context of “good and bad”, and exploring the human capacity of the wild extremes of violence and altruism from moment to moment [1:31:00];</li>
<li>PMS: How two women with identical hormone levels can have completely different emotional experiences [1:35:30];</li>
<li>How much of a role do genes play in depression and other emotional states? [1:39:15];</li>
<li>Why is cortisol elevated under sleep deprivation? [1:46:45];</li>
<li>The impact of stress on cancer [1:51:00];</li>
<li>The impact of stress on atherosclerosis, dementia, addiction, and depression [1:57:45];</li>
<li>Impulsiveness, impaired judgement, and lack of empathy in times of stress [2:02:15];</li>

      <title>#43 – Alan Bauman, M.D.: The science of male and female hair restoration – how to protect, enhance, and restore the appearance and health of the hair and scalp</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<div>In this episode, Alan Bauman, certified hair transplantation surgeon and hair restoration expert, discusses both male and female pattern hair loss, the science behind what drives it, and what that tells us about prevention and restoration. Having treated over 20,000 patients, Alan shares his invaluable insights into what works and what doesn’t in terms of the non-surgical treatment options. We also go into great detail about the more invasive approaches like PRP, and of course, hair transplantation, a procedure which Alan has refined over the years into a proprietary method that seems to produce unbelievable results. Additionally, Alan provides tips for maintaining scalp health, which is vital for hair growth, as well as the importance of choosing a hair specialist who has the tools, expertise, and patience to develop a compassionate and encompassing approach to hair restoration.<br><br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>We discuss:<br></strong><br><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Alan’s unique path, and how he became interested in hair transplantation [3:45];</li>
<li>The prevalence of hair loss, types of hair loss, and the different patterns in men vs. women [12:15];</li>
<li>The role of genetics in hair loss, and when does it start [15:30];</li>
<li>Female hair loss: the role of hormones, pregnancy related hair loss, and what it means to have thinning and shedding [19:00];</li>
<li>Primary drivers of male hair loss, finasteride as a treatment, and the potential side effects [22:45];</li>
<li>Common treatments – Proscar, Propecia, Rogaine, and more – how they all came about and what you need to know [26:15];</li>
<li>Primary drivers of female hair loss, potential treatments, and the different types of hair follicles [29:45];</li>
<li>What are some of the unproven/snake oil methods of hair treatments being pushed to the public? [33:45];</li>
<li>Preventative steps to take if you’re worried about future hair loss [38:30];</li>
<li>Medications that may negatively affect hair quality [42:00];</li>
<li>The importance of seeing a hair specialist [43:45];</li>
<li>Impact of scalp health and inflammation on hair growth, how to pick and apply shampoo and conditioner, and how to avoid and treat hair breakage [46:45];</li>
<li>Treatment options – finasteride, minoxidil, laser caps – how they work and what you need to know [53:45];</li>
<li>PRP treatment: How it works, details of the procedure, and Alan’s proprietary protocol [1:08:15];</li>
<li>The hair transplant procedure [1:26:00];</li>
<li>Risks involved with a hair transplant procedure [1:40:30];</li>
<li>Is a donor hair susceptible to the forces of the implant site that caused the hair loss? Can a hair follicle grow anywhere on the body? [1:44:15];</li>
<li>Age appropriate procedures, how far the field has come, and why Alan loves his work [1:48:15]; and</li>

      <title>#42 – Avrum Bluming, M.D. and Carol Tavris, Ph.D.: Controversial topic affecting all women—the role of hormone replacement therapy through menopause and beyond—the compelling case for long-term HRT and dispelling the myth that it causes breast cancer</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<div>In this episode, Avrum Bluming, hematologist, medical oncologist, and emeritus clinical professor at USC, and Carol Tavris, social psychologist and author of Mistakes Were Made (But Not By Me), discuss their collaboration on their recent book, Estrogen Matters. Their book takes on the very polarizing and confusing topic of hormone replacement therapy for women suffering with symptoms of menopause. In many ways, the story and history of HRT is in striking parallel to the bad science that led up to the dietary guidelines being set forth in 1980. Carol and Avrum make a compelling case that most women benefit greatly from being on postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy, and can do so without increasing their risk of breast cancer. We also cover the history of HRT, the impact of the Women’s Health Initiative, and take a deep dive into each of the clinical conditions for which HRT should be considered, such as cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative disease, and osteoporosis, to name a few.<br><br><br>
</div><div>Do you have questions about this controversial topic? Dr. Bluming has graciously offered his email to take questions directly from fans of the podcast: avrumzbluming@gmail.com.<br><br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>We discuss:<br></strong><br><br>
</div><ul>
<li>The background of Carol and Avrum, and the impetus for writing Estrogen Matters [5:15];</li>
<li>The sad early history of hormone replacement therapy, treatments for prostate and breast cancer, and the difference between the treatment of women vs. men [10:30];</li>
<li>What hormones do, and why they drop off rapidly in women compared to gradually in men [16:45];</li>
<li>Mistreatment of women leading to great skepticism [20:15];</li>
<li>Breast cancer vs heart disease: Comparing the incidence and mortality in women [22:30];</li>
<li>Case studies of women suffering symptoms of menopause [26:30];</li>
<li>What are Carol and Avrum’s true motivations in this endeavor? [29:15];</li>
<li>The changing perceptions of HRT, the impact of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI), and the problems with the WHI [34:15];</li>
<li>Is this one big conspiracy? The uncanny resemblance of the story of HRT and how the dietary guidelines were created [42:30];</li>
<li>Why people (falsely) think estrogen causes a 25% increase in breast cancer, and a lesson in absolute vs. relative risk [53:45];</li>
<li>The truth about progesterone and cancer risk, and the best types of estrogen and progesterone to be taking [1:05:30];</li>
<li>The Women’s Health Initiative: the reported findings, walking back their bold claims, and their hesitance to admit they were wrong [1:14:15];</li>
<li>Brain benefits of HRT, Alzheimer’s disease in women, and estrogen as a preventative treatment for AD [1:19:15];</li>
<li>The impact of HRT on heart disease, the ideal time to start HRT, and the risks associated with HRT [1:23:15];</li>
<li>The benefits of estrogen on bone health, and the incidence and mortality of hip fractures [1:29:45];</li>

      <title>#41 – Jake Kushner, M.D.: How to thrive with type 1 diabetes and how everyone can benefit from the valuable insights</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<div>In this episode, Jake Kushner, pediatric endocrinologist specializing in helping people with type 1 diabetes and Medical Director of McNair Interests, discusses the best strategies to live and thrive with T1D, especially as it relates to diet and exercise. We also discuss why many patients who control their blood sugar with high amounts of exogenous insulin are at a substantially higher risk than people who can control their blood sugar at lower levels of insulin. This concept has great implications for non-diabetics as well considering the increasing prevalence of diseases related to insulin resistance. We also cover some of the basics, the history, the increasing prevalence of type 1 diabetes, and more importantly, what we can do to help kids with this disease, and their families.<br><br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>We discuss:<br></strong><br><br>
</div><ul>
<li>How Jake became interested in type 1 diabetes [2:00];</li>
<li>The pathophysiology of type 1 diabetes, the increase in prevalence, and the role of beta cells [13:30];</li>
<li>The role of body weight and BMI in the risk of developing T1D [23:30];</li>
<li>Genetics of T1D and the risk of inheritance [28:30];</li>
<li>Hemoglobin A1c [32:45];</li>
<li>Insulin: the amazing story of its discovery, its effect on cellular metabolism and IGF-1, and why the hell it’s so expensive [35:45];</li>

          <![CDATA[<div>In this episode, Jake Kushner, pediatric endocrinologist specializing in helping people with type 1 diabetes and Medical Director of McNair Interests, discusses the best strategies to live and thrive with T1D, especially as it relates to diet and exercise. We also discuss why many patients who control their blood sugar with high amounts of exogenous insulin are at a substantially higher risk than people who can control their blood sugar at lower levels of insulin. This concept has great implications for non-diabetics as well considering the increasing prevalence of diseases related to insulin resistance. We also cover some of the basics, the history, the increasing prevalence of type 1 diabetes, and more importantly, what we can do to help kids with this disease, and their families.<br><br><br>

      <title>#40 – Tom Catena, M.D.: The world’s most important doctor – to nearly a million patients – saving countless lives in the war-torn and remote villages of Sudan</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<div>In this episode, Tom Catena, a missionary physician who runs Mother of Mercy Hospital in the Nuba Mountains in Sudan, describes some of his extraordinary work as the only doctor in a remote, war-torn region of Africa. In terms of individual lives saved, you could argue that there is no other person on the front lines doing more than Tom. Additionally, we explore the manner in which the Nuba people die, which is in striking contrast the ubiquity of chronic disease and self-harm in the west, despite the extreme poverty and unimaginable suffering experienced by the Nuba people. Lastly, we discuss the lessons to be gleaned from the Nuba people, who despite their suffering, live so harmoniously, happily, and resiliently. To support Tom’s mission please visit www.amhf.us.<br><br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>We discuss:<br></strong><br><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Background, medical training, and early days of missionary work in Africa [5:30];</li>
<li>Tom arrives at Mother of Mercy Hospital in the Nuba Mountains of Sudan, civil war breaks out, and his staff evacuates [12:15];</li>
<li>Learning surgery on the job and earning the trust of the community [37:15];</li>
<li>The amazing people of Nuba, and why Nuba feels like home to Tom [48:00];</li>
<li>NY Times article about Tom’s work, and Tom’s new venture on the board of Aurora Prize Foundation bringing awareness and funding to other missionaries doing great work [1:00:00];</li>
<li>Tom’s mind-blowing ability to deal with chaos while seeing hundreds of patients per day [1:12:15];</li>
<li>The most afraid Tom has ever been, and how he copes with the emotional trauma of his daily experiences [1:20:00];</li>
<li>The basic tools, technologies, and medicines that Tom is lacking that could save many lives [1:30:00];</li>
<li>The logistical challenge of helping Tom’s hospital, and what Tom really needs [1:35:45];</li>
<li>Diseases in the adult population [1:39:00];</li>
<li>Living without possessions, finding meaning, and being a missionary [1:56:00];</li>
<li>Sense of purpose, happiness, and suicide: Contrasting the US with Nuba [2:07:30];</li>

      <title>#14 – Robert Lustig, M.D., M.S.L.: fructose, processed food, NAFLD, and changing the food system</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<div>In this episode, Rob Lustig — a researcher, an expert in fructose metabolism, and a former pediatric endocrinologist — discusses what’s wrong with the current food environment, and what we can do to reduce our chances of becoming part of the obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) epidemics. Rob recently earned a Master of Studies in Law because he believes that educating people about sugar from a scientific standpoint is only half the equation: the other half involves changing policy, which he explains in this episode.<br><br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>We discuss:<br></strong><br><br>
</div><ul>
<li>What’s the difference between glucose and fructose? [7:00];</li>
<li>Do we have biomarkers that can give us some indication of average exposure to fructose over a given period of time? [14:20];</li>
<li>What’s the difference between ALT and AST? [18:45];</li>
<li>Inflammation, endothelial function, and uric acid [21:30];</li>
<li>Is there something that fructose does better than glucose? [23:45];</li>
<li>For children that undergo a remarkable shift from metabolic health to metabolic derangement, is there a concern that these kids suffer an epigenetic hit that makes it harder for them later in life? [26:15];</li>
<li>How many times do you have to introduce a savory food vs a sugary food to an infant before they will accept it? [29:30];</li>
<li>How are alcohol and fructose similar in how they affect the brain? [33:51];</li>
<li>Advice for parents and kids for creating a sustainable environment that’s going to prevent them from running into metabolic problems [40:30];</li>
<li>Why do some populations have a higher risk of NAFLD? [45:42];</li>
<li>What causes NAFLD? [48:45];</li>
<li>Is insulin resistance the result of NAFLD or is NAFLD the result of insulin resistance? [56:00];</li>
<li>HRV, cortisol, and norepinephrine [1:00:30];</li>
<li>What are the actual mechanisms that links metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, fatty liver, and type 2 diabetes? [1:03:00];</li>
<li>Is the food industry still saying that all calories contribute equally to adiposity and insulin resistance? [1:09:00];</li>
<li>What is the difference between soluble and insoluble fiber and why do you need both? [1:13:00];</li>
<li>How can we change the food system when 10 companies control almost 90 percent of the Calories we consume in the US? [1:15:00]; and</li>
<li>More. </li>

      <title>#10 – Matt Kaeberlein, Ph.D.: rapamycin and dogs — man’s best friends? — living longer, healthier lives and turning back the clock on aging and age-related diseases</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<div>Matt is someone who is deeply interested in understanding the biology of aging. Why do we age? What happens to us as we age? What are the things we can do to slow the aging process? How can we delay or prevent the onset of age-related diseases? These are all questions that Matt thinks deeply about, and explores these questions with his research at the University of Washington. He is currently investigating many of these questions through the Dog Aging Project and the compound rapamycin—the only known pharmacological agent to extend lifespan all the way from yeast to mammals—across a billion years of evolution. We talk about cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer’s disease, healthspan, lifespan, and what we can do to provide longer, healthier lives for both people and dogs.<br><br><br>

<li>Dogs, rapamycin, and its effects on lifespan and healthspan [15:30];</li>
<li>An unexpected finding in presumably healthy dogs [36:00];</li>
<li>Rapamycin in cancer treatment [50:00];</li>
<li>Why isn’t there a rapamycin trial for Alzheimer’s disease (AD)? [1:01:30];</li>

      <title>#09 – David Sabatini, M.D., Ph.D.: rapamycin and the discovery of mTOR — the nexus of aging and longevity?</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<div>In this episode, my good friend David Sabatini delves into his extensive work with the mechanistic target of rapamycin—better known as mTOR—and rapamycin. The compound rapamycin is the only known pharmacological agent to extend lifespan all the way from yeast to mammals—across a billion years of evolution. David, a professor of biology and a member of the Whitehead Institute at MIT, shares his remarkable journey and discovery of mTOR in mammalian cells and its central role in nutrient sensing and longevity. Fasting, rapamycin, mTOR, autophagy, gedankenexperiments: having this conversation with David is like being the proverbial kid in the world’s greatest candy store.<br><br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>We discuss:<br></strong><br><br>
</div><ul>
<li>mTOR and David’s student years [4:30];</li>
<li>Rapamycin and the discovery of mTOR [8:15];</li>
<li>The connection between rapamycin, mTOR, and longevity [30:30];</li>
<li>mTOR as the cell’s general contractor [34:45];</li>
<li>The effect of glucose, insulin, and amino acids on mTORC1 [42:50];</li>
<li>Methionine sensing and restriction [49:45];</li>
<li>An intermittent approach to rapamycin [54:30];</li>
<li>Rapamycin’s effects on cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegeneration [57:00];</li>
<li>Gedankenexperiment: couch potatoes on rapamycin vs perfectly behaved humans [1:03:15];</li>
<li>David’s dream experiment with no resource constraints [1:07:00]; and</li>

      <title>#07 – Deep Dive: Lp(a) — what every doctor, and the 10-20% of the population at risk, needs to know</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<div>This is our first “deep dive” episode that goes into detail on one topic. Pronounced, el-pee-little-a, this lipoprotein is simply described as a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) that has an apoprotein “a” attached to it…but Lp(a) goes far beyond its description in terms of its structure, function, and the role that it plays in cardiovascular health and disease. Affecting about 1-in-5 people, and not on the radar of many doctors, this is a deep dive into a very important subject for people to understand.<br><br><br><br><br>
</div><div>Note: this podcast gets technical at times. The figures in the show notes are your friends. They truly speak more than a 1,000 words apiece. I can’t emphasize enough how helpful it is to look at the figures before, during, and/or after I try verbally walk you through things like kringle repeats, molecular weight isoforms, lysine-binding domains, and plasminogen homology, as a few examples. If you stick with it, I think you will be rewarded.<br><br><strong>We discuss:<br></strong><br><br><br>
</div><ul>
<li>A quick primer on lipoproteins [7:30];</li>
<li>Intro to Lp(a) [11:00];</li>
<li>Lab tests for Lp(a) and reference ranges [20:00];</li>
<li>The physiologic functions of Lp(a) [31:00];</li>
<li>The problems associated with high Lp(a) [34:15];</li>
<li>Lipid-lowering therapies of Lp(a) [44:45];</li>
<li>Lp(a) modification through lifestyle intervention [1:00:45];</li>
<li>High LDL-P on a ketogenic/low-carb-high-fat diet [1:05:30]; and</li>

      <title>#03 – Ron Krauss, M.D.: a deep dive into heart disease</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<div>Whenever I’m stumped on a patient case, or in my thinking about lipids, Dr. Ron Krauss is one of the first people I turn to for insight. I’m not alone. Ron is recognized globally for his research into lipidology and has worn many hats in his career, including clinician, lipidologist, nutrition, genetics, and drug researcher. He received both his undergraduate and medical degrees from Harvard and is board certified in internal medicine, endocrinology, and metabolism. He’s currently the senior scientist and director of atherosclerosis research at Children’s Hospital in Oakland.My hope is that both the curious patient and the physician can get a lot out of this episode by being more informed about dyslipidemia and the interventions used to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral vascular disease.<br><br><strong>We discuss:</strong>
</div><div> </div><ul>
<li>The pathogenesis of atherosclerosis; </li>
<li>How early atherosclerosis begins; </li>
<li>Ron’s motivation for getting into lipidology; </li>
<li>How reading an article series in the NEJM in 1967 had a profound impact on him and his career; </li>
<li>The “battle” between LDL particle size and particle number; </li>
<li>The use of statins; </li>
<li>The role of chronic inflammation in atherosclerosis; </li>
<li>Why niacin may have been unjustly dismissed as a therapeutic option; </li>
<li>The HDL paradox: why drugs that raise HDL-C seem to elevate (or have little impact on) heart disease risk; </li>
<li>Mendelian randomization: nature’s randomized trial; </li>
<li>How PCSK9 inhibitors work and why they may be underutilized; </li>
<li>Lp(a); and </li>
<li>More. </li>

      <title>#01 – Tim Ferriss: depression, psychedelics, and emotional resilience</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<div>In this episode, Tim talks both experientially and from his own deep dive into the literature of psychedelics and mental health. Tim is shifting his focus from investing in startups to funding experiments that he hopes will establish more reliable knowledge and therapeutic options for those suffering from anxiety, depression, and addiction.If this topic even remotely interests you, I can’t recommend Tim’s podcast with Michael Pollan, author of How to Change Your Mind, enough. (You should definitely read Pollan’s book as well.) Even if you’ve never had any exposure to psychedelics or their potential applications, I think you’ll find this subject matter really interesting, and I was very grateful for Tim to be so open and honest about his experiences.Tim also shared his short list of acquired wisdom he returns to most reliably, which might be worth the price of admission alone.<br><br><strong>We discuss:</strong> <br><br><br><br><br><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Tim’s history of depression and his TED Talk on his close call with suicide; </li>
<li>The type of thinking that triggers Tim’s downward spirals; </li>
<li>Tim’s transformative experience with ayahuasca; </li>
<li>How Tim’s experience and research has led him to focus on furthering the science of psychedelics and mental health; </li>
<li>What some of the meditation modalities, and meditation apps, are out there, why can meditation be so hard to do, but also worthwhile to stick with; </li>
<li>Why Tim made a big commitment (more than $1 million) to funding scientific research, and to psilocybin and MDMA research, in particular; </li>
<li>From all the habits and tools that Tim has learned, the five things that he returns to most reliably; and </li>
<li>More. </li>

      <title>#02 – Rhonda Patrick, Ph.D.: the performance and longevity paradox of IGF-1, ketogenic diets and genetics, the health benefits of sauna, NAD+, and more</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<div>Rhonda Patrick, Ph.D. and I go on a Nerd Safari into the jungle of health, nutrition, fitness, performance, and longevity. We visit IGF-1 and whether there’s a tradeoff between having high or low levels. We discuss the PPARs (receptor proteins) and genetic polymorphisms. Does Rhonda think there’s any benefit in a NAD+ booster for health and longevity? Can saunas lower the risk of heart disease, dementia, and all-cause mortality? We dig into those questions…and a lot more.Rhonda is a wealth of knowledge and was the perfect companion to explore several interesting topics in this episode. She puts a great deal of thought and effort into her research, and it really shows in this conversation.<br><br><strong>We discuss:</strong>
</div><div> </div><ul>
<li>What Rhonda believes differently today than she did a few years ago; </li>
<li>The paradox of GH/IGF-1 in performance and longevity; </li>
<li>The role of PPAR in fat metabolism and ketogenic diets; </li>
<li>The possible genetic explanations for why some patients don’t respond well to a ketogenic diet; </li>
<li>The health benefits of heat and cold exposure; </li>
<li>NAD+; and </li>
