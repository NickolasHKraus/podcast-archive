</ul>
<h2>Part 2, Q&amp;A:</h2>
<h2><b>Jessica M. asks:</b></h2>
<h3><b>Discontinuing oral contraception combined with training/hormones</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hi HPN! I really enjoy the podcast. My question is regarding quitting oral birth control (the pill) after over 12 years of continuous use and how that may play into training and hormonal changes.</span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am a 32 y/o female and have been on the pill for 12+ years now. I started the pill simply for birth control (no other reasons like wanting to skip periods, or to prevent cramping or anything else) and had normal periods before starting. The past few years as my training volume has increased (now around 60-90 miles/week average depending on where in the block I am) I have noticed my periods getting lighter and lighter to the point where I have &#8220;normal&#8221; bleeding for only one day or so during my cycle (about 1/2way thru the placebo pills in the pack) and occasional spotting in between. I didn&#8217;t think much of this but recently have begun to wonder if birth control is hiding the fact that perhaps my cycle would be irregular (or even non-existent?) without it. My bloodwork is normal at last check (iron, b12, etc), but i&#8217;ve never had any hormones tested. I always seem to walk the fine line overtraining, although I think I am getting better at taking it easier when my body feels like it needs a rest, but am wondering if perhaps hormones would be playing some role in this.</span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The past few months I have been starting to consider discontinuing the pill. I don&#8217;t want children (in my current situation I don&#8217;t need to worry about this), but am more curious as to what my actual cycle is like or if hormonal balance (or imbalance) is an issue with the higher mileage I have been doing in recent years. I really like the regularity of my periods on the pill but am worried that maybe I&#8217;m just masking an underlying issue.</span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can I still accurately test my hormones (I&#8217;m thinking DUTCH test or something similar) while on the pill to make sure everything is in line? Is there a specific time to take bloodwork to get the most accurate assessment? Just wanted to get your thoughts on this &#8212; discontinuing the pill vs staying on it and assessing hormones etc during training.</span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for everything you do!</span></p>
<h3>What the coaches say:</h3>
<p><strong>Some potential downsides to the pill</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">May cause stomach, gut and digestive issues &#8211; e.g. candida, dysbiosis, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Could deplete nutrients.</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jessica says her B12, iron, etc, are normal but is she <span style="text-decoration: underline;">optimal</span>? We discuss blood lab reference ranges and why normal may not tell the whole story or mean you&#8217;re doing ok.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example: Antioxidants, B vitamins, selenium, zinc can be depleted on the pill.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can negatively affect thyroid. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increases risk of depression.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pill doesn’t balance your REAL hormones, it just suppresses them and replaces them with synthetic ones</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When on the pill, you don&#8217;t necessarily get the health benefits you actually want from natural hormones.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bleed on the pill is a withdrawal bleed not a real period (and you’re not ovulating either).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spotting is generally normal on the pill.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Training and hormones</p>
<ul>
<li>60-90 miles per week is a lot, anecdotally we see more breakdown in athletes beginning to occur when consistently putting in 70+ mpw, both injury risk and hormonal depletion/health issues.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Testing hormones while on the pill</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://dutchtest.com/2015/11/10/should-you-test-a-woman-on-the-birth-control-pill/">What Precision Analytical says</a> (ie DUTCH test, which Jessica is interested in doing):</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Women on birth control pills have suppressed estrogen and progesterone. If you wonder why their progesterone and estrogen levels are low – they are supposed to be when you’re on the pill!&#8221;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You can test the Dutch Adrenal while on the birth control pill however testing the sex-hormones has diminished value.&#8221;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The birth control pill (ring and implants) stops the FSH and LH surge from the pituitary to prevent an estrogen rise and ovulation (thus progesterone production) from the ovary.&#8221;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stopping the pill abruptly won’t just fix things for accurate testing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Precision analytical encourages you &#8220;have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">3 full menstrual cycles without any pill, ring or implant use before testing to ensure the hypothalamic-pituitary communication</span> with the ovary is back on track as best as it can be.&#8221; </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blood testing </span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also best to do after you’re off the pill.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Day 2-4 &#8211; this is the best time to test FSH and LH, i.e. the brain-ovarian connection/communication; hormone levels/results are how the ovaries are responding to messages it&#8217;s getting. </span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Test of fertility, ovarian reserve, etc. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pill stops FSH and LH surge from the pituitary to prevent an estrogen rise and ovulation (thus progesterone production) from the ovary. (Source: Precision Analytical)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Estradiol and progesterone &#8211; test both around days 19-22 of a 28 day cycle.</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Progesterone levels are highest 5-7 days following ovulation. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helpful to get estradiol/estrogen levels in relation to progesterone during the luteal phase especially if estrogen dominance symptoms or PMS issues.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For athletes- this is the time to do your DUTCH and/or blood.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some female philosophy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s personal</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YOU are the only person who truly understands your body and what it needs. YOU are the only one who can determine whether or not the benefits of taking the pill outweigh the risks</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We totally encourage and support any woman who&#8217;s ready to get off the pill or any oral contraceptive. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let your body adapt back to its natural state, support it appropriately, and listen/take action on its cues. It’s time to reconnect with your beautiful self!</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why do it?</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bone health! </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cancer risk, cognitive decline.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because having a natural cycle is HEALTHY and a SUPERPOWER.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To reconnect with ourselves, live in harmony with nature, and work with our bodies instead of against them.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To reestablish trust.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exogenous hormones compromise so much and they down-regulate your muscles ability to recover.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Coming off pill &#8211; a process &amp; practice in patience, listening to your body</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“Hormone imbalance, inflammation, digestive disturbance and as well as others symptoms. These last for an average of at least 4-6 months after coming off the pill.” &#8211; Dr. Jolene Brighten, author or <a href="https://amzn.to/2Rfm3HG">Beyond the Pill.</a></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Athlete specific:</span>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If training with a lot or volume and/or intensity, this may impact the return of a normal cycle and monthly period, must monitor closely. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hormones may not bounce back as quickly as one would hope. This could be for many reasons including an energy imbalance, overtraining, overstressing the body, and any of the things that contribute to typical hypothalamic amenorrhea. </span>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.enduranceplanet.com/?s=amenorrhea"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endurance Planet episodes on Amenorrhea</span></a> (archives)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The question is: If you are seeing a hormonal imbalance and/or amenorrhea, are you willing to make the changes and do the work to heal hormones? This would include things like less training and possibly revising your nutrition, along with overall stress management.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things you can do to help:</span>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morning morning BBT to track ovulation/cycle phase.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extra B6 (100mg/day) for luteal phase defect.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also for luteal phase: extra Mg glycinate and Vitamin C.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider a B complex supplement for total HPA axis support (we love Thorne&#8217;s </span><a href="https://thor.ne/ZRBOm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stress B Complex</span></a>).</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extra Omega 3 fatty acids for hormone production.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vitex for hormone balance, especially progesterone.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The science of the pill and periods for female athletes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32666247/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Effects of Oral Contraceptives on Exercise Performance in Women</span></a>

<h2>Amy asks:</h2>
<h3><b>When is the best time to eat iron-rich food?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I did an IT test and my iron levels are borderline low (in their “needs work” category). I have some great recommendations on what foods to eat&#8211;although open for more suggestions&#8211;and feel ready to fix this issue before it gets worse (trying to avoid iron dropping into their “at risk” category and/or anemia). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So my question is: WHEN is the best time to eat iron-rich foods or take an iron supplement? Is there an optimal time to help better absorb iron? The thing is, I feel like my diet is pretty rich in iron foods anyways (I eat red meat every week, etc) so I was thinking maybe there’s something I’m doing wrong here. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second question is: Is there anything to take or avoid taking with my iron food/supplements? I’ve read some things online about coffee being bad for iron, but am going to look to you guys to give us the lowdown on what the research and science says here!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, how, if at all, does exercise affect iron absorption? Does eating iron foods after a hard workout help boost iron?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for your insight!</span></p>
<h3>What the coaches say:</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://info.insidetracker.com/enduranceplanet"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside tracker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that “50% of females under the age of 50 have suboptimal ferritin levels.” (And only 2% had too high of iron!)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Optimal time to eat &amp; absorb iron?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the morning</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Hepcidin is lowest at this time making for better absorption rates.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Iron supplements should ideally be taken on an empty stomach for maximum absorption, e.g. ideally first thing in AM. However, if this causes upset stomach you can take with a light meal preferably one with Vit C to enhance absorption.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Or: Can also take ~1 hour after drinking coffee (see below) or 2-3 hrs after a meal, before eating again.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Don&#8217;t take directly after exercise, this can negatively affect absorption of iron as well. Wait till rested.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Can take things like <a href="https://affiliates.bodyhealth.com/idevaffiliate.php?id=714&amp;url=4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PerfectAmino</span></a> Amino Acids, etc, directly after exercise while empty stomach.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid having it with calcium, i.e. 300mg or more of calcium rich foods (eg one cup of skim milk) </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid having it with oxalates (spinach, kale, parsley, beets, nuts) </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid having it with grains and legumes unless properly prepared (soaked and sprouted)</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">foods containing phytic acid/phytates can lead to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">50-65% reduction in iron absorption with these (whole grains, beans, nuts, seeds, soy proteins) </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid having with coffee, tea, chocolate, i.e. tannins and polyphenols </span>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up to 60% reduction in absorption with tea and coffee, chocolate, herbs.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tannins in coffee and tea may bind to iron and block absorption</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> .</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6402915/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inhibition of food iron absorption by coffee</span></a>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best to take or eat iron one hour after coffee not one hour before. </span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A cup of coffee reduced iron absorption from a hamburger meal by 39% as compared to a 64% decrease with tea, which is known to be a potent inhibitor of iron absorption.&#8221;</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11029010/">Effect of tea and other dietary factors on iron absorption</a>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;From these calculations we conclude that the presence of sufficient amounts of iron absorption enhancers (ascorbic acid, meat, fish, poultry, as present in most industrialized countries) overcomes inhibition of iron absorption from even large amounts of tea. In individuals with low intakes of heme iron, low intakes of enhancing factors and/or high intakes of inhibitors, iron absorption may be an issue.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heme iron is less affected by the polyphenols of coffee and is less bossed around. </span>You’ll get more iron absorbed from steak and coffee than veggie scramble and coffee.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Avoid having it with excess FIBER
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Excess insoluble fiber can bind to minerals such as zinc, magnesium, calcium, and iron, preventing the absorption of these vital nutrients.&#8221;</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eggs can reduce iron absorption by up to 28%.</span></li>
<li><b>For optimal absorption eat “all meat meals” with some fruit and supplement with that meal.</b>
<ul>
<li><b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eat with a vitamin C-rich food; and/or </span></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">500-1000mg vitamin C.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eat with a food containing heme iron.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to increase ferritin/iron and troubleshooting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid coffee, tea, high fiber, dairy, eggs, chocolate and calcium supplements 2 hours before and after a “meat meal”</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eat your red meat, dark meat, venison with a green salad or fruit for vitamin C. Take iron supplement with this meal. (<a href="https://irondisorders.org/diet/">source</a>)</span></li>
<li>If blood values remain low despite detailed attention to all of this, may need to assess gut health and/or gut dysbiosis that could be preventing proper absorption of not only iron but other nutrients and minerals.</li>
<li>Also check stomach acid, too low?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Iron content in common foods (via Cronometer)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3oz beef liver is 6mg of iron</li>
<li>3oz ground bison/buffalo 2.7mg</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">3oz clams is 2.3mg</span></li>
<li>3oz mussels 3.4mg</li>

<h2><b>Kev asks:</b></h2>
<div><b>Marathon PR &#8211; aiming to get to that next level</b></div>
<div>
<p>Hi team!</p>
<div dir="auto">1st off thanks again for the show! Always look forward to hear it on my long runs!</div>
<div dir="auto">My question is as there are very few races currently in the UK, my only proper race this year is Manchester marathon in mid October. Its a flat, quick route and I want to do well</div>
<div dir="auto">I can manage quite comfortably 40 miles a week, mostly steady paced runs 5 days a week with 1 interval session a week too.</div>
<div dir="auto">My plan was as I do have a pretty big endurance base was to work on speed, to aim for a half marathon pb say 2 months before the race, then up the distance for the long runs and take that speed from the half training to help on the full but will of course be interested in your input please?</div>
<div dir="auto">I&#8217;ve done about 30 races on or above the marathon distance</div>
<div dir="auto">I&#8217;ve been consistently running for 10 years now with no major injuries. 47yrs old and 165lbs</div>
<div dir="auto">I&#8217;ve enclosed my PRs if that helps.</div>
<div dir="auto">Thank you for your time as always.</div>
<div dir="auto"></div>
<h3 dir="auto">What the coaches say:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Red flag: doing a half marathon then increasing volume for the 2 months leading into the marathon: major risk or injury, fatigue, etc.</li>
<li>Instead: Increase volume NOW prior to HM, then maintain prior to HM, then drop volume after HM and before marathon to reduce risk.</li>
<li>Long runs should be at 20-24 miles for someone with this kind of experience (has run 100 milers, etc).</li>
<li>Speed is not the problem. It&#8217;s strength and muscular endurance that&#8217;s making his 5k better relative to marathon, i.e. marathon is weak point. (Need to be able to grind a hard pace for 26.2, not just 5k).</li>
<li>Lead up to HM: focus also on strength, tempo, threshold, muscular endurance- type workouts. Can sprinkle in intervals/speedwork in there by using the short stuff like 200s as a warmup for example, or maybe even some strides or 50m sprints toward the end.</li>
<li>Marathon pace is tempo/Z3ish feeling.</li>
<li>If you can easily run 40 miles per week, then bump that to 50 mpw! That is, if you have the time and space to allow that added volume.</li>
<li>15 weeks out: peak at 50 miles for the week, but don&#8217;t do that much after the HM</li>
<li>Example workouts for marathon success:</li>
<li>One day hard, two days easy, repeat&#8230; allow for more recovery. Hard is harder! E.g. instead of 20 mile long run, do 18 miles long run with more quality, for example:
<ul>
<li>3 mile warmup</li>
<li>5 x 1min intervals: hills at Vo2; walk down for recovery (takes of edge so your not fresh for the pace efforts)</li>
<li>3 mile cruise at MAF</li>
<li>3-6 miles at marathon goal pace</li>
<li>3 miles easy</li>
<li>3-6 miles goal pace</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lucho is not a fan of long goal pace runs for marathon, if you can do tons of miles at marathon goal pace you&#8217;ve set the goal too easy. And it also decreases confidence! Keep yourself hungryyy for a big goal, within reason.</li>
<li>Tempo is a good place to start by adding a good stimulus to long runs.</li>
<li>But don&#8217;t worry about goal pace early on; rather, go by the FEELING (pace will change hopefully for the better).</li>
<li>The feeling is: you kind of want to slow down but you don&#8217;t have to, there&#8217;s some pressure there but not a struggle. E.g. MAF+ 10 bpm. Or Threshold minus 10-15 bpm.</li>
<li>Just because all your long runs aren&#8217;t MAF doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re missing the focus.</li>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Scott asks:</b></span></h2>
<div><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Strength programming and a Q on that &#8220;hypertrophy range&#8221; for endurance athletes:</b></span></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Hi Lucho and Tawnee,</div>
<div>A question for you on strength programming for endurance athletes:</div>
<ul>
<li>Should we avoid the 8-12 rep &#8220;hypertrophy&#8221; range as defined by NASM and focus only on strength/power (&lt;= 6 reps) and muscular endurance (&gt;=12 reps) across the phases of the year?  (Assuming the goal is endurance performance and not actually gaining size)</li>
<li>Or is the &#8220;hypertrophy&#8221; label for this range too narrow of a definition of the adaptations that occur and there is indeed a reason to train in this 8-12 rep range?</li>
</ul>
<div>Thanks and Cheers from Switzerland!</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 dir="auto">What the coaches say:</h3>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><b>Hypertrophy:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b>
<ul>
<li><b></b>Hypertrophy, is the result of an increase in the amount of contractile proteins within each muscle fiber.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
<li>Hyperplasia can happen but it&#8217;s more rare and not the main means to gaining bulk.</li>
<li>How is hypertrophy achieved?</li>
<li>&#8220;While there are a number of ways to induce hypertrophy in the weight room, it seems that employing multiple sets with moderate loads (6-12 reps, 65-85% 1RM) and rest periods (60 seconds) creates the greatest elevation of testosterone and growth hormone (primary anabolic hormones); compared to heavy loads (1-5 reps, &gt;85% 1RM) with long rest periods (2-5 minutes) and light loads (12+ reps, &lt;65% 1RM) with short rest periods (30 seconds) (Schoenfeld B. J., 2010).&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://www.nsca.com/contentassets/d27e2ba7e56949229d3eb1aaef7ddcfa/trainertips_hypertrophy_201601.pdf">Source NSCA</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Muscle hypertrophy doesn’t exactly happen as you’d expect with concurrent strength and endurance training &#8211; reason for this is at a molecular level. Why?
<ul>
<li>&#8220;AMPK also acts to inhibit the Pl-3 k/ mTOR stage of the pathway via activation of the tuberous sclerosis complex thereby suppressing the ST induced up regulation of protein synthesis [185, 186]. This conflict arising at a molecular signaling level therefore appears to impair the muscle fiber hypertrophy response to ST and attenuate increases in body mass [186].&#8221; (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29249083/">source</a>)</li>
<li>In other words: mTOR is released during or as a result of strength training and that otherwise would help build muscle tissue; however, mTOR is suppressed by adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase (AMPK), which is an enzyme that is released in response to endurance exercise. Basically, AMPK overpowers mTOR preventing big gains in strength training as long as one is endurance training enough.</li>
<li><strong>As long as you&#8217;re doing about 3:1 endurance training to strength training, roughly, you&#8217;re not going to have massive hypertrophy gains.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Practically speaking for athletes: what is your goal with strength training? Most endurance athletes using strength training as supplement to bigger goals of endurance gains. In other words, you don&#8217;t want to become a stronger runner by doing in work in the gym, needs specificity.</li>
<li>When we make a muscle bigger, we reduce capillary density, thus reducing endurance efficiency, not something endurance athletes want or need.</li>
<li>Increasing squat max has other side benefits- efficiency, durability, etc, allowing you to run better and get faster (i.e. indirect benefit).</li>
<li>Squats also pinpoint biomechanical needs to endurance athletes.</li>
<li><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29249083/">Effects of Strength Training on the Physiological Determinants of Middle- and Long-Distance Running Performance: A Systematic Review</a>, (mentioned above) also says:
<ul>
<li>“Importantly for the distance runner, measures relating to body composition are not negatively impacted by a ST intervention. The addition of two to three ST sessions per week, which include a variety of ST modalities are likely to provide benefits to the performance of middle- and long-distance runners.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lucho poses the idea that most athletes don&#8217;t need to go into a true strength training phase of training outside the exceptions. But that doesn&#8217;t mean we don&#8217;t need strength training, we just need small amounts to get the benefits as endurance athletes. E.g. get &#8220;strong enough&#8221; to support your endurance goals. Hypertrophy, reps, sets, etc&#8230;. just doesn&#8217;t matter for this population of athletes.</li>
<li>What if you DO WANT hypertrophy/lean body mass (LBM) gains:
<ul>
<li>Diet matters for positive protein status:
<ul>
<li>&#8220;hypertrophy occurs is by growth of individual muscle fibers. This is a result of altering protein turnover in favor of net protein synthesis (Figures 2.15 and 2.l6). Strength training causes a short-term increase in protein degradation, but a longer-term increase in protein synthesis (Figure 2.l7). Adequate protein and carbohydrate consumption before or after a strength-training workout can shift protein turnover further toward a positive protein balance by reducing degradation and increasing protein synthesis.&#8221; (Source: Essentials of Sports Nutrition book)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Decrease endurance and increase strength (more like a 2:1, 1:1 E:S or even less E and 3+x week strength.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
<li>Timing! Wait 3+hr minimum after E to do your S (minimum, this may not even be enough). Anabolic response from S lasts 18ish hrs, so don’t do more E in that time for max S gains.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
<ul>
<li>Programming: endurance soon after strength diminishes anabolic response (less hypertrophy).</li>
<li>Separate sessions by at least 8 hours.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Load! At least 70% 1RM for 6-12 reps, 3ish sets, 1ish min rest (60% 1RM eg 17RM or even lower weight with high reps won’t elicit much, but also 1RM near max won’t elicit much hypertrophy either).</li>
<li>Multi joint free weight exercises.</li>
<li>Sometimes you see that you have to give up endurance training for a while if you really do want to gain weight and muscle mass.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chronically injured and using strength training to help? Keep it more functional, not heavy lifting (at least not right away). Also related: special situations like a post-knee replacement surgery. We give examples of what to do in the gym.
<ul>
<li>Bottom line: Address deficiencies at a functional level before adding heavy loaded strength training.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Split schedules of endurance and strength.</li>
<li>Always better off doing strength before endurance if you must do them back to back. And the good news is, you don&#8217;t completely wreck your strength gains (it&#8217;s a LOT safer this way).</li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Martin asks:</b></h2>
<div><b>Aerobic gains + Strength gains &#8211; how to get &#8217;em both?</b></div>
<div>
<p>Hi, I am not an endurance athlete but despite that I love the show. It is helpful and I have listened for about 5 years. Please keep the content coming. I have to admit. I am an avid ATC listener and less avid for the “100 km trail run advice” type episodes.</p>
<p>I do judo ( just think wrestling) which requires a combination of strength, endurance, and explosiveness. Typically, five 4-8 minutes fights over a 1 hour period in a competition. Nothing too serious. Just a hack but an avid hack.</p>
<p>I have incorporated the MAF concept to create a baseline aerobic fitness that has been very helpful, as when others (even those much younger) are puffing I am just on aerobic idle. Phil would probably shudder at how I have, as I don’t go for “runs” but do it more via body weight calisthenics and walking up hills. Apologies Phil, I am sure I am not the first to deviate from your great advice, but “horses for courses”. Things like obstacle courses &amp; cross fit style workouts kind of feel like “just judo warmups”.</p>
<p>I can become very fit aerobically or become strong through strength-based training, however balancing the two is quite a dance/ dark art. Got any tips on how to balance the two?</p>
<p>Boring stuff: Male. 178 cm. 69 kg. Late 50’s and super active. I am a good runner when I put my mind to it, but didn’t find out to my forties, and I find it dull, and not very relevant. Wiry build, am relatively stronger in my upper body than lower body, but I am making efforts to correct that. Walk 1 ½ hours per day in hilly areas (guess it adds to MAF). 30 minutes weights per day, and maffy style calisthenics workouts 3 time per week. Plus judo training several times a week. Apologies, I have no metrics I can send you, like a runner can.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">What the coaches say:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Defining the goal(s).</li>
<li>He needs muscular endurance, not so much MAF-type training. (Though not a waste to do MAF, just doesn&#8217;t seem that sport-specific to judo).</li>
<li>If HR is elevated for hour+ duration, this is aerobic endurance exercise even if sub-MAF, i.e. a fat-burning activity.</li>
<li>90min of easy walking may not be doing enough for his goals.</li>
<li>Ideas for cross-training as an alternative to the walks:
<ul>
<li>More explosiveness-type training as a focus, perhaps.</li>
<li>Hill intervals &#8211; 45min worth or so.</li>
<li>Try a MAF test to see what aerobic run fitness is like. Then: Run at MAF 1x a week (a little bit more than just walking).</li>
<li>Functional endurance: Sprint intervals with a heavy weight of some kind (medicine ball, sand bag, etc) that you&#8217;re throwing up the hill and chasing. Or: crawling up a hill, hill bounding, carrying something dynamic (rock, baby, etc), run up a hill sideways.</li>
<li>Dynamax balls are a good tool.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t worry about losing strength gains if overall endurance/aerobic work is minor.</li>
</ul>

<p>On this special episode, host Tawnee Gibson recently had the opportunity to catch up with professional triathlete Katie Zaferes who is an Olympian, WTS world champion, Super League champion<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>and UCAN athlete. A video version of this interview aired on UCAN’s FB page, which you can watch <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/UCANCommunityGroup/permalink/443107556744031">here</a>.</p>
<p>On this episode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Katie talks about living in a tiny home with her husband, Tommy. Their move into a tiny house was featured on the TV show <em>Tiny House Nation</em>.</li>
<li>During the pandemic, Katie stepped away from intense training. She wanted to be mindful of energy so that she isn&#8217;t burnt out mentally and physically before reaching the Tokyo 2021 Olympics.</li>
<li>The fast, aggressive nature of races was an issue that Katie had when fueling for her sport. The nutrition that she used to use did not give her the energy she needed to sustain a race.</li>
<li><a href="https://ucan.co/shop/share/enduranceplanet/">UCAN</a> preemptively helps Katie fuel for races, giving her the sustained energy she needs for a 2-hour race. During the race, she also has one bottle of UCAN on the bike.
<ul>
<li>Weeks before the race starts, she visualizes <em>when</em> she is going to take in her sports nutrition.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Katie started working with a sports nutritionist which helped her dial in her fuel.</li>
<li>A variety in fuel is really helpful! UCAN offers a wide variety of nutrition from almond butter to different kinds of powders and bars.</li>
<li>What a typical day of eating looks like for Katie:
<ul>
<li>For breakfast: 2 servings of Oatmeal with a half serving of <a href="https://ucan.co/product/cocoa-energy-protein-tub/">Cocoa Energy and Protein Powder</a> plus other toppings like peanut butter, blueberries, or mango.</li>
<li>Then Katie will go to her first training session of the day and eat an <a href="https://ucan.co/product-category/energy-bar/">energy bar</a> or drink a mix with the SuperStarch.</li>
<li>For lunch: 3 eggs, a ton of vegetables, plus tofu, tempeh, or ham.</li>
<li>Before her next workout, Katie will have The <a href="https://ucan.co/product/plain-energy-tub/">SuperStarch unflavored</a> mixed with <a href="https://ucan.co/product/watermelon-hydrate-electrolyte-jar/">watermelon hydration</a>.</li>
<li>For dinner: protein, veggies, and carbs. If the training day is lighter, she will eat a huge salad.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is so important to have enough energy to fuel workouts, even more so if you&#8217;re tired. Using something like UCAN is an easy way to get in those calories so that you make sure you&#8217;re getting the energy you need.</li>
<li>During hard sessions, Katie uses one bottle filled with unflavored SuperStarch mixed with watermelon hydration. And one bottle filled with plain water.</li>
<li>Before the race, she is going to have a UCAN energy bar on hand if she needs it before the race. On the bike, she will use a gel for fast energy. And another gel on the run if she needs it.</li>
<li>You can find UCAN gel recipes online!</li>

<h2><b>Peter asks:</b></h2>
<div><b>Advice for running the 14ers:</b></div>
<div>
<div class="gmail_default">Hey guys, Love the podcast!!!</div>
<div class="gmail_default">I am training to run/hike all the 14ers in colorado this august in under 30 days. I am planning on doing a ton of MAF pace running and then lots of steep hiking at MAF pace as well. I&#8217;m currently doing about 15 miles per week and am starting to bump the mileage up each week. What else should I be doing for training? what kind of mileage running and or steep hiking should I be doing each week? I want to be able to finish the 14ers in good shape because I am also looking at attempting some FKT&#8217;s in the fall and hopefully a 50k race. Thanks!</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What the coaches say:</h3>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li class="gmail_default">One of the biggest challenges here will be the consistent stress from altitude for 30 days.
<ul>
<li class="gmail_default">Because of this altitude stress, your nutrition needs to be spot on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The range of altitude training is highly individualized because of genetics.
<ul>
<li>The first general range of adaptation occurs around 7,600 ft.</li>
<li>The second general range of adaptation occurs around 10,500/11,000 ft.</li>
<li>The third general range of adaptation occurs around 17,000 ft</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For this particular case, you want to start getting up to at least 7,600 ft. Then you will want to get to 10,500/11,000 ft to prepare you well for the 14ers.</li>
<li>The things that will matter the most:
<ul>
<li>Your experience at altitude. Every time you reach a specific altitude, you decrease the amount of stress it has on your body.</li>
<li>Your nutrition at altitude. Be on top of your nutrition starting on Day 1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When you come down and rest from elevation, you will need to focus on replenishing your glycogen stores; this is <em>not</em> a time to go low-carb.
<ul>
<li>For your body to metabolize fat, it takes about 20% more oxygen than it does for carbohydrates (i.e., if you eat almond butter, your body will need 20% more oxygen to metabolize that).</li>
<li>Practice having a good liquid calorie intake with an emphasis on heavy carbohydrates.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re coming up to the top of the 14er, and you&#8217;re starting to feel really bad, a coke might be the best option. You don&#8217;t want to make your body do any more work than it is already doing at that altitude; you need something that doesn&#8217;t require any digestion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Overall mileage doesn&#8217;t need to be high, but your ability to hike steep climbs <em>and</em> descend well is going to be extremely important. Bring poles!
<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t worry too much about speed climbing; focus on downhills and muscular endurance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://antonkrupicka.com/">Anton Krupicka </a></li>
<li>Aim for 30 miles per week with an emphasis on hiking (see: <a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00546.2015">Energetic of vertical kilometer for races; is steeper cheaper?</a>). For example, run until your heart rate gets 10 beats over MAF then hike.</li>
<li><a href="https://trailrunnermag.com/people/a-guide-to-running-colorados-14ers.html">Article from Trail Runner Magazine by Brian Metzler</a></li>
<li>Topical magnesium and Perfect Aminos</li>
<li>Get out of altitude (preferably below 7,500 ft.) for recovery.</li>
<li>Strength training: Bulgarian split squats, lunges, plus anything that will target quad eccentric and hip extension. Also, tricep extensions and shoulder work for poles and packs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="gmail_default"><b>Laura asks:</b></h2>
<div class="gmail_default"><b>Help on Uphill race training</b></div>
<div class="gmail_default">
<div>I am planning on doing a race on September 13th which is 2.86 miles and 1200 foot elevation gain. Currently I am trying to build my base running all MAF. What training can I add in to prepare for this race? And how do I incorporate it with my MAF training?</div>
<div></div>
<div>I don&#8217;t know that my specifics are relevant to this question but just in case. I am a 45 year old female and have been racing for 6 years. My best 5k was 25:28 minutes and that is the distance I race at almost all of the time. I have done one half marathon at 2:08. I like races with 100 feet elevation gain and find 200 feet to be more challenging slowing me down roughly 30 seconds a mile. My MAF pace is a 13 min/mile average with a little bit of walking to keep my heart rate down, and I have been sticking to flat ground in an attempt to get past the walking phase since I started MAF in January. I know it will be hard to run up that much elevation, my goal is to run the race and not have to walk much if at all. I am not sure what I can do to prepare and it somehow seems particularly at odds with MAF training.</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What the coaches say:</h3>
</div>
<div class="gmail_default">
<ul>
<li>Start with a base period of MAF.</li>
<li>Vertical climbing requires much more than good aerobic fitness. Strength will play a large role in vertical climbing.</li>
<li>The coaches are assuming you&#8217;re not using MAF on race day.</li>
<li>Focus on getting MAF pace a little better over the next month. Then start to incorporate hard hill strides (e.g., 5-10 second strides). If your race is at an 8% grade, use that as a minimum for the grade you will train on. You can train on a lower grade if you increase the intensity of the strides.</li>
<li>Start with a 5-10% grade &#8211; max effort; then start to increase the duration of strides.</li>
<li>Do longer runs on hilly courses.</li>
<li>Work on intervals at a higher heart rate, 1-2 times a week.</li>
<li>Work on &#8220;enjoyable effort.&#8221;</li>
<li>Keep it fun!</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Gina asks:</b></h2>
<div><b>Return to swimming?</b></div>
<div>After about a year away from the pool due to covid and closures, I&#8217;m finally ready and able to get back in the pool! Prior to the virus and shutdowns, I was swimming 2-3 times a week, training for triathlon (sprints, Olympic, and 1-2 70.3s a year) and my sessions would vary from 2k to 4k with all sorts of types of intensity (from LSD to sprints, drills, etc). I am a mediocre swimmer but love it. Since then I have done stretch cords, but not as consistent and swimming fitness is junk right now. What&#8217;s the best and safest way to get back to it to avoid overdoing it and causing an injury? (I&#8217;m super excited to get back in the pool and I know I&#8217;m going to have to hold back from doing too much too fast!)</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What the coaches say:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Most injuries are preventable &#8211; don&#8217;t ignore what your body is telling you.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t go all out!</li>
<li>Rotator cuff exercises with stretch cord &#8211; good to use as a prehab.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t pull too much if your shoulders aren&#8217;t strong and durable; if you do pull, use a pull buoy and no hand paddles.</li>
<li>A good early base period for swimming: DRILLS. Do a lot of drills! A lot of kicking.</li>
<li>Make sure your first two weeks of swimming are capped out at 1k. An example of the first month back:
<ul>
<li>First and second week capped at 1k with drill focus</li>
<li>Third week 1500, but the volume added would include kicking and non-free</li>
<li>Fourth week 2k</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>On this episode:</p>
<h2>Part 1:</h2>
<h3>Coffee talk:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Julie and Tawnee chat about mushroom elixirs and coffees that feature special blends of adaptogens like Four Sigmatic and Om. You can find mushroom elixirs over at <a href="https://us.fullscript.com/welcome/eplanet">Fullscript</a> and get a discount when you create and account through endurance planet!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Julie’s carnivore experiment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Animal-based diet (aka the carnivore diet)
<ul>
<li>What is it ?</li>
<li>Elimination of all seed oils and high-toxicity plants; eat lots of organs, meats and fish plus low toxicity plants (fruits, veg)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What Julie learned:
<ul>
<li>Getting over 100g of protein isn’t THAT hard</li>
<li>More organs and bone broth and steaks than ever before&#8212;beef, bison, chicken once, fish, fruit, eggs, avo, olives, squash, cheese, berries, oranges, bananas, apple, salt (SOLE!)</li>
<li>Woke up feeling rested and chatty</li>
<li>No night sweats except when taking Mg and almonds the first two days</li>
<li>Felt better, connective tissue healing</li>
<li>Muscle spasm in hamstring on day 6; low on calcium so added in goat kefir and pecorino which is sheep cheese.</li>
<li>Diet is low on folate</li>
<li>Dips in energy especially in afternoon&#8212;wasn’t getting the calories</li>
<li>Constipated&#8212;enzymes or kefir didn’t work or celery juice; was it the cheese, sauna, and carbonated water causing this?</li>
<li>Typical Day: black coffee, date, 3 eggs and 2-3oz of organs, canned fish/apple/banana/EPIC bar, bone broth, organs, honey leftover meats/squash, avo, then dinner was a meat/fish and squash with cheese. Dessert as berries and goat kefir</li>
<li>On missing veggies</li>
<li>The notion we as society have that &#8220;green juices,&#8221; all veggies and leafy greens and plant-based is inherently healthier than meat&#8230; but is that always the case?</li>
<li>Tailoring the carnivore diet to be more realistic and balanced</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Julie also tried vegan diet a while back! Listen to her thoughts on being fully plant-based here:  <a href="https://www.enduranceplanet.com/hpn-19-potato-puree-vs-sports-gels-put-to-the-test-cleaning-up-a-poopy-problem-and-cultivating-a-healthy-mindset-for-a-healthier-body/">HPN 19: Potato Purée vs. Sports Gels Put To The Test, ‘Cleaning Up’ A Poopy Problem, and Cultivating A Healthy Mindset For A Healthier Body</a></li>

<h2>Part 2:</h2>
<h3><strong>Study discussion</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32805028/">Avocado Consumption Alters Gastrointestinal Bacteria Abundance and Microbial Metabolite Concentrations Among adults with overweight or obesity, an RCT (August 2020)</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objective:</strong> “Evaluate the impact of daily intake of avocado on the fecal microbiota and microbial metabolites and to assess relations between metabolic health markers, microbial taxa and metabolites in overweight and obese.”</li>
<li><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> Basically they predicted that avocado consumption would positively impact the intestinal microbiota and be a dietary strategy to improve health among adults with overweight or obesity</li>
<li><strong>Study: </strong>
<ul>
<li>Subjects: 163 overweight/obese men and women</li>
<li>Ate: roughly one full avocado daily or not; 12 weeks (otherwise they had regular diet)</li>
<li>Women received 140g of Haas avocado per day as part of an isocaloric controlled meal, men 170g.</li>
<li>The study meals were designed to replace one meal a day and included ingredients of standard american foods. The avocado group had 20g more MUFA than the control group and 14g of additional fiber and 300cals higher. Bodyweight did not differ between groups. Saturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, carbs and protein were similar between groups</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Daily avocado consumption = “Evidence that this nutrient-dense food affects digestive physiology, as well as the composition and metabolic functions of the intestinal microbiota.”</li>
<li>This study also showed avocados support fat digestion and insulin secretion, which contributes to better blood sugar regulation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>More specifically:</strong>
<ul>
<li>increased diversity and enriched the following between 26% and 65% compared with the control group.</li>
<li>Faecalibacterium</li>
<li>Lachnospira</li>
<li>Alistipes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>The avocado group had:</strong>
<ul>
<li>18% greater fecal acetate (a SCFA that increases colonic blood flow and enhances ileal motility)</li>
<li>70% greater stearic acid</li>
<li>98% greater palmitic acid concentrations</li>
<li>Bile acids cholic and chenodeoxycholic acid were 91% and 57% lower, respectively.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Daily avocado consumption resulted in:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Lower fecal bile acid concentrations
<ul>
<li>Bile acids help with fat digestion and regulate systemic metabolism and insulin secretion.</li>
<li>Greater bile acid concentrations are associated with obesity and diabetes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Greater fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA)
<ul>
<li>Avocados are rich in fiber, including soluble hemicelluloses and pectins that can be metabolized by intestinal microorganisms to produce SCFAs</li>
<li>Short-chain fatty acids: these are made when you eat fiber, and they help maintain gut barrier immunity.</li>
<li>Low SCFA associated with dysbiosis, gut inflammation and functional bowel disorders.</li>
<li>High SCFA associated with decreased GI disease.</li>
<li>N-buyrate is a type of SCFA that is the preferred energy source of cells lining the colon; helps regenerate colonic mucosal membrane. It is the result of bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates that have resisted digestion in the small intestine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Greater relative abundances of bacteria capable of a healthy type of fermentation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Other studies on avocados show:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Eating avocados regularly is associated with lower body mass, improvements in satiety and healthier blood lipid concentrations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Downsides to eating avo?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Avocado is a high histamine food; histamine drives many everyday allergies (seasonal, etc). If this is a problem for you may need to limit avocado intake until histamine issues is resolved.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Part 3:</h2>
<h2><strong>Cassie asks: </strong></h2>
<h3><strong>How to combat within-day energy deficits?</strong></h3>
<p>Hi Tawnee and Julie,</p>
<p>Thanks for this podcast; I look forward to HPN all month! I’ve been reading and hearing a lot about within-day energy deficits, and I think it’s a problem for me (maybe partly why I have only gotten one period since having my IUD removed a year ago?). I have a really hard time eating enough during the day (I’m a teacher, so I can’t just snack whenever, especially now that we have to wear masks and face shields all day). I’m wondering if you can give me some advice for better spreading out my nutrition throughout the day.</p>
<p>Here’s what a typical day looks like for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 am- wake up, do 10-20 minutes of yoga, have a cup of black coffee</li>
<li>5:45- Breakfast (usually some sort of egg bake made of eggs, veggies, and maybe some ground turkey; sweet potato; avocado or guacamole</li>
<li>6:15- leave for work</li>
<li>7:30- students start arriving (mask and face shield on)</li>
<li>11:00- Lunch: dinner leftovers and a piece of fruit</li>
<li>2:45- end of the school day. If I don’t have a meeting and remember to have a snack,</li>
<li>I’ll eat 2 boiled eggs and half a sweet potato (more food than that makes for a rough run later)</li>
<li>4 pm- workout: 1-2 hours of running and/or strength training (I’m training for a 6-hour trail run in April)</li>
</ul>
<p>So, by this point, I’m super hungry. I’ll grab a couple handfuls of nuts while cooking dinner. Dinner is some sort of meat, some sort of leafy or cruciferous veggies, and a starchy veggie or rice. After dinner, I’m generally still hungry, so I’ll have a bowl of frozen berries with some nut butter and maybe a scoop of protein powder and some coconut flakes. Sometimes I’m STILL hungry, so I’ll eat something like an RX bar.</p>
<p>Bedtime is 9:00. I’ll read for a while and try to be asleep before 10.</p>
<p>As you can see, I’m eating a lot at night, which is not awesome. Can you help me figure out how to spread that out a little more and fuel better during the day?</p>
<p>Thanks so much! Keep up the awesome work on the show!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What the coaches say:</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A review of within-day energy deficits and research on this topic</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Episode mention: <a href="https://www.enduranceplanet.com/hpn-15-is-keto-bad-for-bone-health-plus-the-risks-of-intermittent-fasting-for-female-athletes-and-why-we-say-a-hard-no/">HPN 15: Is Keto Bad For Bone Health? Plus: The Risks of Intermittent Fasting For Female Athletes (And Why We Say ‘A Hard No’)</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29205517-within-day-energy-deficiency-and-reproductive-function-in-female-endurance-athletes/"><b>Within-day Energy Deficiency and Reproductive Function in Female Endurance Athletes</b></a> &#8211; a 2018 study looking at 25 female elite endurance athletes and within-day energy deficits
<ul>
<li>Within-day deficits were classified as any 1-hour window where energy deficit was in a 300-kcal deficit (&lt;300kcal).</li>
<li>within day deficits are shown to suppresse resting metabolic rate, lower estrogen levels, increase cortisol levels</li>
<li>Eating empty calorie or low nutrient value snacks may feel safe but might not do the trick for healing</li>
<li>All athletes spent time in an energy-deficient state, but the athletes with menstrual dysfunction had 24% more time in a deficit. (Also of note: total daily energy intake was not statistically different!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Our thoughts:
<ul>
<li>It’s not about never going without food, but rather avoiding too many deficits too often. don’t feel like you can never have a day with a deficit, it’s avoiding chronic deficits and when healing this is what I mean when I say you often have to go above and beyond to send the body the right message for rebalancing hormones and menstrual function then can tailor from there.</li>
<li>Must consider: individual variance + confounding variables, for example some may have lower or higher thresholds for what leads to healing or dysfunction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cassie&#8217;s situation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Amazing awareness and so glad you’re asking for help!</li>
<li>Also great that Cassie is not running/training fasted first thing in the morning before school, most likely this is an understanding she’s gained knowing a practice like that does not serve her or her cortisol levels.</li>
<li>Cronometer calculates her at 3,000cal/day</li>
<li>Julie’s ideas:
<ul>
<li>Bigger breakfast&#8212;egg bake AND oatmeal. Front load your day better since your job inhibits snacking</li>
<li>Variety: are you rotating between different macros? Different types of protein sources and cuts. Different grains/beans/carb sources. Different types of fats? Could be a deficiency somewhere that is leaving you hungry</li>
<li>Up the carbs at night? How much rice or starchy carb is involved in that dinner?</li>
<li>On days you weren’t able to eat enough, chop some of the training that afternoon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Tawnee recently did an interview with pro triathlete Katie Zafares who recently signed on with <a href="https://ucan.co/share/enduranceplanet/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCAN</span></a>, and we talked about Katie’s diet and daily eating habits. Of course she trains and eats like it is her job&#8212;because it is&#8212;but a couple things stood out that we can realistically carry over into our own practices as amateur athletes with “day jobs” to avoid pitfalls or calorie deficit. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GenUCAN/videos/2874253802827356">Head over to the UCAN FB page and watch/listen to the interview now.</a></li>
<li></li>
<li>Further ideas:
<ul>
<li>No black coffee on an empty stomach. Eat first then sip caffeine. Even better—consider cutting out caffeine all together for a while. (Maybe try decaf adaptogenic mushroom drinks?)</li>
<li>If you are eating a whole food-based clean diet for your main meals of the day, try not to over-worry about utilizing supplemental foods, powders, bars and those more snack-type foods to get in those much-needed calories when you’re busy.
<ul>
<li>Eg) Katie talked about her 3 meals a day, which were all whole foods made from scratch, but then between meals she’s using <a href="https://ucan.co/share/enduranceplanet/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCAN</span></a> powders/drinks and bars to make sure she hits her daily needs, and she even mentioned how her coaches are checking to make sure she’s eating enough.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Liquid calories are easy. You can sip on this and not have it interfere with your work or covid policies.
<ul>
<li>Julie suggests: Add in a smoothie to sip on when you’re not teaching or during the in-betweens/commutes/RIGHT after working out.</li>
<li>Add in a spoon of almond butter before coffee? Or add in MCT oil and collagen to coffee NOT as a replacement of any calories in breakfast but as a supplement of calories that support your training.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Using “convenience” foods that are still clean fuels (sooooo many options these days!) is not a diet fail and may mean the difference between healthy vs dysfunctional hormones.
<ul>
<li>Fearing these foods may signify some degree of disordered eating patterns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Covid era and masks&#8212;how to navigate putting your health as a priority while being safe to you and those around you with the virus taken into consideration.</li>
<li>Maybe explain to your school administration, to your comfort level, the medical reasons for needing to eat more frequently during daytime hours and not have large gaps without fuel.</li>
<li>Consider STRESS! What is your relationship with stress right now? Back then? How anxious are you? Food matters, calories matter, but there are other components too&#8212;stress is usually a big factor in this equation.</li>
<li>On extra stressful days or weeks, try swapping out a run for a meditative/parasympathetic type activity instead! Balance is key. Can’t always keep pushing and expect body to heal or respond favorably.</li>
<li>It will behoove you to re-evaluate exercise/training/race goals and/or style of training. Is it serving you in this season of life? Maybe put off “big goals” till body is back to a better baseline, covid life is less stressful and work stress isn’t sky-high.</li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Ryan &amp; Steph ask:</b></h2>
<div><b>Combining short-duration critical power with Ironman long-haul training </b></div>
<div>
<p>Let’s say you now have 17 months to prepare for your 2020 ironman distance race (Roth&#8211;due to covid we will now be racing it in 2022, along with doing a cycling tour in France after the full-distance tri).</p>
<p>As far as bike training goes, the majority of training and racing we&#8217;ve had for the past 10 months is on Zwift (some summer outdoor rides plus the only other race since covid being the Cedar City Belgian waffle ride of 125mi last Oct). The majority of training and racing for at least the next ~6 months will also be on Zwift. While Zwift has actually been really fun through all this, providing lasting friendships that likely would never have happened, and we have perfected a devastating attack OFF the back of the pack&#8230;. we would also like to be able to attack FROM the back of the pack just once or twice. How, as an endurance athlete, would you go about boosting your 15 second to 1 minute power, which would help achieve this goal in Zwift racing? This seems to be most important in Zwift racing that we&#8217;re finding. And because we like to be difficult athletes, how might we utilize this in our 17 month build to boosting our 6 hour power.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What the coaches say:</h3>
<ul>
<li>On the most basic level, you&#8217;re trying to change muscle fibers mid-ride; one of the most important aspects of making this change is to make sure you&#8217;re not doing it when you&#8217;re already cooked/exhausted (but you don&#8217;t always have that choice).</li>
<li>Make sure you know when to attack and if you can.</li>
<li>You can ruin your race if you attack and you&#8217;re already cooked.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re going to attack, you need to choose that time wisely.</li>
<li>Generally, an attack of over 40 seconds is a mistake. An attack over 40 seconds will most likely make you blow up.</li>
<li>When Lucho was an elite Ironman athlete, his rule was to never cross zone 4.</li>
<li>If you want to attack, you need to be confident in your ability to elevate and to continue to keep that faster pace.</li>
<li>If you want to attack from the back of the pack, make sure that the pack is small (6-10 riders).</li>
<li>Ryan should probably attack on a hill.</li>
<li>A good strategy for an attack: Max effort for 15-20 seconds to create some distance from the other riders, then you&#8217;re going to relax and ease back off to steady-state. The chase group will have to catch up, and once they do, you&#8217;ll be all rested and ready to go again.</li>
<li>What should training look like for this?
<ul>
<li>2 minutes at zone 2, then 1 minute at zone 5. Repeat for a total of 10-15 minutes.</li>
<li>1 minute in zone 4, then 30 seconds in zone 6; this is more realistic as it will mimic race strategy.</li>
<li>2 minutes in zone 3, then 30 seconds in zone 6.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When you can no longer reach the goal wattage &#8211; you&#8217;re done.</li>

<h2><b>Annie asks:</b></h2>
<div><b>How does power output differ on trainer/Zwift vs. outdoor riding?</b></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div>Hi Tawnee and Lucho!</div>
<div>Thank you for your help in my question below (you referenced it in an episode a while back, and I&#8217;ve been doing some soleus and gastroc stretches + eccentric weighted heel lowering, and haven&#8217;t had many problems since).</div>
<div></div>
<div>BACKGROUND for my question:</div>
<div>When COVID started, Peloton released their app for free for two months.  I joined, and started doing cycling classes on their app while on my trainer, and loved it &#8211; but I only had my heart rate for data.  So this Christmas, my husband got me the Peloton.  I&#8217;ve drank the koolaid and am in love.  DATA DATA DATA!!!!  Some of their instructors are endurance athletes (Matt Wilpers is my fav, you should have him on EP), and I love taking their power zone classes and learning more about FTP and output.  While I have a ton of endurance experience, I have been utterly humbled.  I take some of their live classes with my friends, and am totally left in the dust when it comes to overall output.  I&#8217;m uber competitive, and I know I&#8217;ll eventually see some improvement here&#8230;but it leads me to an overall question.</div>
<div></div>
<div>MY QUESTION:</div>
<div>How does output in a spin session (like Peloton, Zwift, etc) compare/correlate to outdoor riding?  Some of my friends that have a higher overall output at the end of a 60min session are the same friends that I can totally hang with (if not leave in my dust) on a long outdoor ride.  So, while I am competitive, should I just be paying attention to my own numbers and stop the comparison (well, yes, I should)?</div>
<div>Like I had mentioned in my previous question below, I have a background in crossfit.  As an endurance athlete, I was never one that could squat heavy, but I could squat 30 reps of 85% my max (and probably more if my coach would have let me keep going).  Comparing my output numbers to others kind of reminds me of this from the crossfit gym &#8211; different strengths for different body types.</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What the coaches say:</h3>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>You see your friend&#8217;s power output, but you don&#8217;t see effort!</li>
<li>When riding outdoors, there is an increased use of motor units being used to drive the bike. On the indoor trainer, you lower the percentage of muscle fibers being used which lowers your wattage; because of this, 200 watts outdoors might feel easier than 200 watts indoors.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t worry about a perfect transfer between indoor and outdoor riding &#8211; so many variables go into it. You may want to set up zones independently for indoor vs. outdoor rides.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Mel asks:</b></h2>
<div><b>Best cross training and &#8220;diet&#8221; for ultrarunning</b></div>
<div>Hi! I&#8217;ve decided to give ultrarunning a go more formally. I am a 40 y/o female and my background is primarily in marathons (PR 3:10) and a few random 70.3s and a couple 50ks but the latter were just for fun at the time and nothing serious. I want to build toward doing a 100k then a 100 mile (not sure on timeline yet but I&#8217;m already comfortable running 50 mpw and have a good base and strong MAF pace of ~8:20). I feel comfortable with a training plan for the longer running (I mean, isn&#8217;t it just about a lot of running?!) but I am wondering what kind of crosstraining you would suggest. I have a bike trainer/zwift, a decent at-home gym, can swim outside in warmer months, access to trails, etc., and I like being able to mix it up. But is that hindering my run progress? Is it just about focusing on the run or do you think Xtraining for ultra makes an actual difference and if so how much percentage of training (or time) would you invest in non-running activities?</div>
<div>Also- might be more of an HPN question but I would like to hear Lucho&#8217;s take on diet for ultra-athletes. I&#8217;m not interested in anything restrictive and I have no diet restrictions, but am curious about the claims some of these diet &#8220;gurus&#8221; seem to make. Keto/low carb is still so trendy these days (fat burning for long endurance makes sense but is keto too far?), and then things like carnivore and vegan too. I am not looking to follow &#8220;one diet&#8221; but rather mix in the &#8220;best of&#8221; what these approaches may allow for, including being able to keep my strong gut and handle taking in nutrition while running. The diet Q is just my quest to get the best out of myself. Any dietary approaches to avoid?</div>
<div>Thanks for your considering my question! It will be such a trip if I tune into EP and hear my question answered while I&#8221;m out running ha!</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What the coaches say:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tawnee is personally a fan of mixing it up when possible and being an overall fit, resilient athlete. At the same time, we don&#8217;t want to sacrifice the bigger goal of building a body that is ready for the type of mileage you want to run.</li>
<li>Cycling doesn&#8217;t help speed-based runners. But for ultrarunners (where running is slow), cycling can be useful to the overall development of an endurance athlete.</li>
<li>Athlete/runner aside, strength training will help you as you age.</li>
<li>Lucho would recommend avoiding fast-food (McDonald&#8217;s, Jack in the Box, etc.), junk food, etc. But it&#8217;s also okay every once in a while.</li>
<li>If there are obvious errors in your macros, work on that.</li>
<li>Make sure to eat enough!</li>
<li>Ask yourself, how do you feel?</li>
<li>Buy organic when possible, grass-fed meats, buy local or from farmers markets, soak grains before consuming, and avoid industrial seed oils.</li>

<p><a href="http://www.strongrunnerchicks.com/team/">Megan Flanagan</a> of <a href="http://www.strongrunnerchicks.com">Strong Runner Chicks</a> joins host Tawnee Gibson for a special collaboration episode featuring some of their top empowering mantras and tips for a more successful 2021 and beyond.</p>
<p>Megan is a former collegiate runner turned competitive trail, ultra, and OCR runner. She works in the healthcare industry alongside being a certified running coach, strength coach, and the founder of Strong Runner Chicks (SRC), which is a women&#8217;s community dedicated to educating, empowering, and connecting women in distance running, as well as host of the SRC podcast. She is an amazingly positive and inspirational soul who, on this episode, shares her story and why she started SRC along with a few of her personal mantras. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/meginspire/">Click here</a> to follow Megan on Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Intro</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tawnee and Megan share their personal experience with their eating disorders and disordered eating, as well as their journey towards healing.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Tawnee’s Mantras </b></p>
<p>1. Control and perfection are illusions</p>
<ul>
<li>Healing the inner child. Years of undoing conditioning (e.g., eating disorder=control; triathlon=seeking perfection).</li>
<li>Allowing the mind to evolve, getting unstuck and out of a fixed perception of self.</li>
<li>“In order to be who you are, you must be willing to let go of who you think you are.” -Michael Singer</li>
<li>Getting more comfortable with the “as-is” state; stop wishing for another now.</li>
<li>“Perfection is not a prerequisite for anything but pain.” &#8211; Tara Brach</li>
<li>Getting more comfortable with the past &#8212; the good, bad, ugly, traumatic. Allowing the past to be an experience for growth and not fixate on the imperfections.</li>
<li>We don&#8217;t need to let go of those who we have lost; the goal is <em>to feel</em> and <em>not resist</em> grief, to dig deeper and understand life because of it.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3rhKQHO">Untethered Soul by Michael Singer</a> (please support the podcast by using this link!).</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Be my authentic self and do not fear the judgment or criticisms of others</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning to accept criticism with an open mind instead of fear and worry. Instead of an auto reaction &#8212; contemplate and respond mindfully; ask if this is something I need to hear.</li>
<li>Explore the <em>why</em> to what you&#8217;re doing.</li>
<li>Don’t be afraid to be who you are.</li>
<li>Be humble, inquisitive, and curious about others.</li>
<li>Tawnee is conditioned to be a people pleaser, but it is exhausting and ineffective. Trying to please everyone betrays who she is.</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Trust my intuition</p>
<ul>
<li>Trusting intuition also means recognizing and detaching from irrational fears, worries, and anxieties—toxic thoughts that try to play mind games with us.</li>
<li>We are often too busy, too distracted, too upset to listen to the part of us deep down that knows.</li>
<li>Coming from an eating disorder past, it’s not always easy to trust yourself but it’s a beautiful thing when it finally works.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Megan’s Mantras</b></p>
<p>1. “Create the things you wish existed.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Manifestation (making those visions and dreams into a reality!); creating Strong Runner Chicks (podcast and community); looking for opportunities to bring new ideas into the world and our running space.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. ”Personal growth is not a matter of learning new information but of unlearning old limits.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Forgoing limiting beliefs (e.g., noticing words like <em>should</em> and <em>can’t,</em> seeing excuses come up, etc.) and opening up opportunities to what is possible.</li>
<li>We create our reality. If there is something you want to see happen in your life (acknowledging that there are a lot of factors that predetermine this), you have the power to change your circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Showing up fully/authentically and letting the chips fall</p>
<ul>
<li>Going all in and not holding back &#8211; on big dreams, etc.</li>
<li>Trusting that things will play out and that showing up each day is the most important piece to continuing to create connections and make an impact in the long run.</li>
<li>Taking ownership in creating safe and inclusive spaces.</li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Part 1:</b></h2>
<h3><b>Seasonal Eating Guide&#8212;Spring!</b></h3>
<h3><b>A reminder of our seasonal picks for previous seasons (click on the link for full show): </b></h3>

</ul>
<h3>Spring 2021 picks:</h3>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asparagus</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nettles</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dandelion greens </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lemons </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of a 5th food for the spring season, we have homework for YOU! Find a local farmers market (FM) if you don’t already attend one regularly and talk to a farmer, ask them what’s fresh, and bring some home! If you already go to FM regularly, then be adventurous and try something NEW that you’ve never bought before. Write in and tell us what you found! #shoplocal #eatseasonally</span></p>
<h3><b>#1 Asparagus:</b></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seasonality: April to mid-July, but can start as early as February.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4 Varietals: green, white (covered in soil, no chlorophyll), purple, and wild.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What to Look For: the thinnest stalks possible as they are the most tender. Should have a fresh scent, if it smells musty give it a pass. Rich in color and stand firm.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Part of the clean 15! No detectable residues on 90% of samples. Doesn’t like much water; their water footprint is pretty low.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Storage: It Goes downhill pretty quickly, so trim the ends and stand it in the cup of water in the fridge.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can peel asparagus. Don’t overcook, can enjoy raw, shaved, grilled, roasted, steamed. Trim it! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grasp a stalk with one hand around the root end at its furthest point, and the other about mid-way down the stalk and gently bend. Wherever it breaks is where it should be trimmed to.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nutrition: Vitamin C, folate, potassium, vitamin k, inulin (prebiotic fiber). Fiber, mostly insoluble which forms bulk to the stool, and some soluble fiber which draws water from the intestines creating a gel-like substance to help move things along.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asparagus Pee: Excreting sulfur compounds into the urine; it’s likely that everybody produces it but not everybody smells it.  </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>#2 Dandelion greens:</b></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sprouting up on lawns across the country &#8211; one of the first signs of spring. </span></li>
<li>Anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-diabetic, and anti-microbial properties.
<ul>
<li>Study: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5553762/">The Physiological Effects of Dandelion (<em>Taraxacum Officinale</em>) in Type 2 Diabetes</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Good for liver health protection and liver function and detox support; cleanse and flush toxins (Chinese medicine uses to treat hepatic diseases).</li>
<li>Dandelion is rich in Polyphenols (the main source of dietary antioxidants) with chicoric acid (CRA) (phenolic acid) as the most abundant component of dandelion, found in all parts of the plant.</li>
<li>Drink as a tea or as an herbal coffee.</li>
<li>Generally, the concentration of polyphenols is higher in flowers and leaves than in stems but they are included in all parts.</li>
<li>Dandelion contains: Vitamins K plant-based A and C, even D, E, B! Also: inositol, lecithin, and minerals such as iron, magnesium, sodium, calcium, silicon, copper, phosphorus, zinc, and manganese.</li>
<li>“The root of dandelion contains inulin which includes fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS). This complex carbohydrate can help to normalize blood sugar levels; it reduces hyperglycemia and can be really beneficial for gut health &#8212; FOS is a complex carbohydrate; its intake benefits bifido-bacteria, which eliminate pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract [66]. As a result of mineral absorption, FOS stimulates the immune system, and thereby suppresses abnormal cell growth.” (Source from the study mentioned above.)</li>
<li>“Also contains chlorogenic acid; CGA has been a potential compound for preventing obesity and inflammation. It also impacts on insulin secretion and sensitivity, making it an attractive option for use as a future anti-diabetic drugs [61, 71].” (Source from the study mentioned above.)</li>
<li>“It has also been demonstrated that dandelion extract is able to reduce hepatic lipid accumulation by activating the phosphorylation of AMP and AMPK, hence protecting against NAFLD and eventually against hepatic steatosis (fatty liver disease) [126].” (Source from the study mentioned above.)</li>
<li>“Dandelion is one of the richest sources of [plant-based] beta-carotene (11,000 µg/100 g leaves, same as in carrots), from which vitamin A originates [66]. In the past few years, dandelion has demonstrated health benefits including anti-rheumatic, anti-carcinogenic, diuretic, laxative, hypoglycemic, and chloretic effects [67].” (Source from the study mentioned above.)</li>
<li><strong>Incorporating Dandelion in food &amp; drink</strong>
<ul>
<li>A bitter green to add to salads, juice, or drink dried dandelion teas</li>
<li>“The health-promoting benefits of dandelion can be attributed to the presence of these bitter substances and of phenolic components, which possess anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activities [44].”
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5553762/">How much to consume:</a> Renowned physicians, the European Commission, and the British Herbal Pharmacopoeia recommended the following range of doses for dandelion:
<ul>
<li>Fresh leaves 4-10 g daily</li>
<li>Dried leaves 4-10 g daily</li>
<li>2-5 ml of leaf tincture, three times a day</li>
<li>Fresh leaf juice, 1 teaspoon twice daily,</li>
<li>Fluid extract 1-2 teaspoon daily</li>
<li>Fresh roots 2-8 g daily</li>
<li>Dried powder extract 250-1000 mg four times a day</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>#3 Nettles:</b></h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seasonality: Start showing up late winter to early spring depending on where you live. They can&#8217;t withstand the heat, after a 90-degree day they’ll be gone.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grows wild in forests and woodlands near streams and rivers in NA, Europe, parts of Asia, Russia, and Northern Africa.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Either forage them or buy from a farmer who foraged them for you.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Storing: extremely perishable, will keep for a few days in the fridge. Wear gloves until soaked or cooked. </span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uses: much like spinach. Pesto, sauces, soup, pizza or pasta topping, with eggs, nettle tea.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://simplynourishednutrition.com/simply-nettles/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nutrition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (link to nettles chart): 1 cup is 6g of fiber and 2g protein. A, K, Calcium, Iron, Potassium, Mag &#8211; outperforms kale, spinach, and dandelion in calcium, magnesium, iron, potassium, and vitamin A. </span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicinal: long regarded as a botanical healer &#8211; Naturally detoxifying and anti-inflammatory it’s been used for gout, anemia, and joint pain. Native Americans have long been using it not only as a general tonic but for fevers and to help with childbirth.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>#4 </strong><b>Lemons</b></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another polyphenol powerhouse. It’s so obvious and available that you might pass it by, but it’s coming into peak season so stock up this spring</span></li>
<li>Possible negative effects if eating lemons regularly:
<ul>
<li>Concerns with enamel erosion (maybe use a straw if you’re worried).</li>
<li>If you have any GI upset or internal issues, you may need to avoid doing it on an empty stomach</li>
<li>Lemons may trigger migraines in some people; source: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1608828751?ie=UTF8">Migraine Miracle</a> (please help support the podcast by using the link).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>“Immense therapeutic potential because of their anticancer, anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory nature and also serve as an important ingredient in the formulation of several ethnic herbal medicines.” (<a href="https://www.eurekaselect.com/185757/article">Source</a>)</li>
<li>&#8220;In animal studies, the citric acid found in lemon water has also been shown to protect liver function and prevent oxidative damage, helping preserve the liver’s natural ability to detoxify.&#8221; (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4026104/">Source</a>)</li>
<li>Lemon water first thing in AM is an easy way to consume &#8211; a bonus &#8211; you&#8217;ll help meet your hydration needs! It can help combat cravings, promote regular bowel function/constipation relief, detox support, adrenal support, energy, and more.</li>
<li>Combined with exercise (walking 7k steps a day), a lemon a day was shown to help lower BP. (<a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jnme/2014/912684/">Source</a>)</li>
<li>Packed with vitamin C:
<ul>
<li>Lemons contain about 50-75mg vitamin C per 100 g of juice. Looked at another way, just 1 cup of fresh lemon juice provides more than 150% of your daily recommended serving of vitamin C (one lemon is about 30-40%).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also contains fiber, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and copper, as well as vitamins B1, B2, B6, folate, and pantothenic acid/B5- good for adrenal health.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Part 2:</b></h2>
<h3><b>Science of Cravings &amp; Stress Mitigation</b></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not from a lack of willpower or a complete emotional failure. We now understand there is a biochemical reason for cravings and we want to help you determine what that is (usually many) and then using that knowledge to begin the process of deconstructing the craving/habit/behavior.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cravings are a signal that our body is out of balance &#8212; What is causing the imbalance? Where are they coming from?</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poor night’s sleep</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dehydration (minerals) &#8212; </span><a href="https://nourishedkitchen.com/sole-water/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SOLE WATER</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nutritionally</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Energy Deficit from not eating all day or just the first half (ravenous for dinner?) because you didn’t plan or have been ignoring your hunger cues for so long. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blood sugar imbalance &#8211; what goes up must come down.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gut health &#8211; inflammatory foods mess with your intestines causing an imbalance of bacteria and throwing our neurotransmitter production off and wanting more comforting and quick-energy foods. Triggers could be gluten, seed oils, artificial sweeteners, sugar, processed foods, low-quality dairy.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3">Micros/Macros &#8211; minerals, water, magnesium, protein, fat.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stress</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hormones</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ghrelin (the hunger hormone), Leptin (Satiety hormone), Neurotransmitters serotonin (hug someone!), and dopamine (try something </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">new</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get a dopamine hit!)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Habitual</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We create this habit/feedback loop that we consider to be a craving. Eat when angry? Excited? Stressed? Sad? Certain time of day? Certain location? With a certain show? When changing tasks? Buy certain things at certain stores? Hostess cupcakes when buying the paper?</span></li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">NO judgment, you are not weak because you have cravings. They are normal! Use them to learn more about yourself and your environment</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Neurotransmitters Involved:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Dopamine</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">known as the feel-good neurotransmitter—a chemical that ferries information </span>between neurons. The brain releases it when we eat food that we crave or while we have sex, contributing to feelings of pleasure and satisfaction as part of the reward system (ever reach your goal? The feelings involved is a rush of dopamine)
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-to-increase-dopamine#TOC_TITLE_HDR_7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What else increases Dopamine? </span></a>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eat enough protein &#8211; tyrosine (beef, pork, fish, chicken)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Probiotics &#8211; gut and brain connection!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exercise, sleeping 8-9 hours</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sleeping and waking same time every day. Reducing noise and light in the bedroom. Limit caffeine/alcohol/sugar</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When people are forced to stay awake during the night, the availability of dopamine receptors in the brain is dramatically reduced by the next morning”</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listening to music (instrumentals)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meditation and sunlight</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try something NEW</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><b>Serotonin</b>: helps regulate mood. Calm, relaxed, focused, motivated, happier, emotionally stable
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-serotonin-425327">Needed for production:</a> Tryptophan, B6, Omega-3s, Vit. D (most in your gut!)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunlight, Fish, Bananas, Turkey, Beans, Eggs, Leafy Greens</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aerobic exercise</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massage &#8211; decrease cortisol and increase serotonin</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hug someone!</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>What CAN we do when we get a craving:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pause, approach with no judgment. Give yourself time to switch from the emotional brain to the logical brain.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask yourself if you are truly hungry, or just eating for the sake of eating. Or ask yourself, “What part of me is this nourishing?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eat at a designated eating station &#8211; sitting and mindfully and joyfully. Have a date with yourself at the table!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Envision your life as a movie and you are the lead character &#8212; how does this scene end? Joyfully? Great. Uncomfortable and disappointed? Rewrite the scene, gain trust back in yourself.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Alternative Ways to Deal with Stress:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meditation or any mindfulness practice; baby steps &#8211; even 1 minute at a time makes a difference!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go outside &#8211; forest bathing. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grounding &#8211; piggybacking off forest bathing, get barefoot and TOUCH nature; if you don’t want to take off shoes cause it’s cold, touch a tree or anything in nature.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connect with someone somehow.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Affection, touch, conversation, gift-giving.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a creative side project.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listen to music, dance, yoga.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">More specific to music: Sound wave therapy
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try listening to 528Hz, known as the “love frequency” it is a healing frequency that you can find in music among other places in nature to help restore balance, reduce stress and cortisol.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is one of 7 solfeggio frequencies each of which offers specific benefits. You can find this stuff for free on youtube and just let it play for hours (but even just a few minutes really seems to help calm).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><a href="https://meditativemind.org/benefits-of-music-based-on-7-solfeggio-frequencies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://meditativemind.org/benefits-of-music-based-on-7-solfeggio-frequencies/</span></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3">Gratitude practice (and less focus on all that’s negative).</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure enough sleep </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supplements </span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stress B Complex by Thorne; they have a few different B complex supplements, but Tawnee loves the Stress formulation! Extra B5 for adrenals and immunity.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">L-Theanine to reduce anxiety and physio signs of stress.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mg Bisglycinate 2-3 hr before bed (citrate or carbonate may cause loose stool for those sensitive; can also relieve constipation &#8212; something like Natural Calm or BodyHealth Calm). </span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also a transdermal Mg spray (Tawnee sprays this on after her workouts). Mg spray is Mg chloride.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DON’T RELY ON SUPPLEMENTS, YOU STILL HAVE TO DO THE HOLISTIC WORK </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Epsom salt bath (which is basically Mg sulfate) </span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only do baths ROCK, with Epsom salts they support detox and can help you bounce back if you feel like you&#8217;ve been dragging and overwhelmed with stress; also counteracting too much exposure to radiation and technology (either for work, travel, health procedure like an MRI or just sensitive to tech).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not much research on these baths.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mg absorbed thru skin, increases blood levels (</span><a href="http://www.epsomsaltcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/report_on_absorption_of_magnesium_sulfate.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one study showed increase in serum Mg after a week of baths</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mg helps 100s of biochemical reactions and enzymes so epsom salt baths in theory may boost these functions, helping you feel better.

<p>On this episode:</p>
<h2><b>Matt asks:</b></h2>
<div><b>Recovery intervals &#8211; what difference do they make in performance gains for endurance athletes?</b></div>
<div>Hi! I&#8217;d love to hear more on the science of recovery intervals and why they matter so much (some say they matter even more than the work interval). What does &#8220;full recovery&#8221; mean? What difference to my training/fitness does it make if I take full recovery vs. partial recovery? How do I know what kind of recovery interval I need for certain workouts, for example 400s or 800s on the track vs. hills vs. mile repeats, tempo, and longer stuff. Do/should recovery intervals change with the season? What&#8217;s the benefit to &#8220;incomplete&#8221; recovery intervals (i.e. either maintaining a certain intensity or a very short recovery interval)?</div>
<div>I&#8217;m looking to apply this to both marathon training and probably triathlon in the future (once racing starts to happen safely again).</div>
<div>
<h3>What the coaches say:</h3>
<ul>
<li>What does it mean to have a full recovery?
<ul>
<li>Depends on the intensity and goal of the workout, and what you want to get out of it.</li>
<li>Intensity is based on energy systems.
<ul>
<li>If you want full recovery, you have to fully recover each energy system that you use.</li>
<li>Each energy system takes a certain amount of time to recover. For example, the PCR (phosphocreatine system) takes about 2 minutes. But to fully recover lactate, it can take up to 15 minutes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Too much (or too little) rest isn&#8217;t good. Too much rest can shut down the Krebs cycle and the whole cycle will have to start over again once you start your next interval. Every individual&#8217;s Krebs cycle is different depending on fitness level.</li>
<li>The Step Test is a basic fitness test that measures heart rate and recovery; typically, the quicker the heart rate drops down, the more fit you are.</li>
<li>Full recovery will be very subjective to where you&#8217;re at as an individual.</li>
<li>Typically, the number one mistake athletes make is that they don&#8217;t take long enough rest intervals.</li>
<li>The study mentioned: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30297216/">The effects of recovery duration on psychological and perceptual responses of trained runners during four self-paced HIIT sessions</a>.
<ul>
<li>Conclusion: &#8220;Longer recovery durations may facilitate a higher external training load (faster running), whilst maintaining a similar internal training load (physiological stimulus), and may therefore allow for greater training adaptations.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When does it make sense to do incomplete/partial recovery?
<ul>
<li>The only time partial recovery is <em>not</em> a good idea is when you&#8217;re working on speed. Partial recovery is okay, but as long as you recognize that you&#8217;re not working on speed.</li>
<li>The question: Is the quality of form, breakdown, and injury risk increasing when there isn&#8217;t proper recovery in between intervals?</li>
<li>There is an optimal level of intensity for lactate clearance (about 50%-60%). For example, if your doing an interval at a 6-minute pace, jogging at a 9-minute pace for the rest interval would be better than standing still.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tawnee recommends the Jack Daniels&#8217; method if you&#8217;re training for a marathon; he clearly states what recovery should look like for each type of workout.</li>
<li>The Maffetone method would recommend listening to your body.</li>
<li>Tabatas have a great basis in science, but is it worth the risk? And can you do something better that is safer? Lucho would reserve tabatas for the elite of the elite.</li>
<li>What do you want to get out of the workout during hill intervals will determine your recovery interval length.</li>
<li>For tempos, RPE is the best. Lucho will prescribe his athletes a total amount of volume he wants them to run; the athletes can break it up however they need to get that volume.</li>
<li>A 1-minute rest (even up to 2-3 minutes) will not affect your workout outcome.</li>
<li>Jack Daniels&#8217; VDOT Chart allows you to factor in seasons.</li>

<p><strong>On this episode with <a href="https://philmaffetone.com">Dr. Phil Maffetone</a>:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Getting strong the &#8216;slow weights&#8217; way</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Phil&#8217;s new book on strength training: <a href="https://amzn.to/3nwI6nv">Get Strong</a> (released Nov 2020)</li>
<li>Why endurance athletes might reconsider 2-3x a week of heavy and/or intense strength training workouts mixed into their program</li>
<li>How and what kind of strength training can inhibit aerobic fitness, and not allowing proper recovery can impair fitness(proper</li>
<li>The concept of slow weights and how a strength workout can fit into your day without even having to change clothes or feel sore afterwards</li>
<li>Using 80% of your 1-rep max at a self-paced manner for a non-fatiguing micro strength workouts into your day, in a way that compliments endurance training rather than interferes with it</li>
<li>Fitting in strength training into your home “gym” with little equipment, or taking it outside</li>
<li>Tawnee shares how she approaches slow weights with heavy rocks and how it also made strength training more doable as a new mom</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Self-care in uncertain times</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What are things we can do at home that complement our well-being. Things we can do on our own, that may not require physician guidance<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
<li>We talked to Phil back in May 2020 where he guided us on seasonal allergies, covid and overeat pandemics, gut health and more, <a href="https://www.enduranceplanet.com/dr-phil-maffetone-25-steps-to-naturally-overcome-seasonal-allergies-social-distancing-from-sugar-and-more/">listen here.</a></li>
<li>It all resorts back to controlling the stress we experience</li>
<li>Focus on the stress that media exposure and consumption may be causing us</li>
<li>Adding more stress crashes the immune system making us more susceptible to illness—covid or otherwise</li>
<li>Reasses short term and long term goals with the changes we’ve all experienced in the past year</li>
<li>The kitchen is not a vending machine</li>
<li>People are buying more junk food than ever right now, but we should be focusing on healthy food more than ever!</li>
<li>Covid rescued the junk food injury in a way—junk food is comfort food</li>
<li>Make your home a comfortable, happy place. A place you want to be</li>
<li>Setting up a cozy home enrionvment; for Tawnee that means NOT having TV streaming all day long</li>
<li>Junk food and sugar is an addiction like drugs can be, using them as an excuse to sooth stress and “reward” one’s self is not the healthy answer</li>
<li>Social media censoring more content these days, but not comments that are harmful to our health like condoning high junk food intake</li>
<li>Do Phil’s strict healthy eating recommendations go “too far” for those of us who may be experiencing or are susceptible to eating disorders / disordered eating?</li>
<li>Phil explains the difference between unhealthy restrictive behavior vs choosing healthy food for a genuine interest in one’s health and wellbeing</li>
<li>Phil’s case that this is about wanting to feel good every day, and that justifies a more strict approach to food choices and how to let go of unhealthy obsessions</li>
<li>The key is understanding control is an illusion, we can’t control it all, and allowing some flexibility is key to success. Not having unhealthy thoughts that we need to be perfect.</li>
<li>If one as more at risk for certain health conditions it warrants more need to focus on diet.</li>
<li>“Let’s eat like humans should eat!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
<li>Using the example of fish: not getting overly restrictive or obsessive about food choices, but also being mindful of choosing the best-quality fish with lowest toxin load. (Read more at <a href="https://philmaffetone.com/fish-myths/">Phil’s article on fish here</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Wearables &#8211; the good and ugly of these devices</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What good can they provide in alerting us to the internal state of our health and measurements of our well-being<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>but what risks and harms can they introduce into our lives.</li>
<li>The key is adjusting your lifestyle if the information your receiving from a wearable is not desirable, but this is where people struggle the most</li>
<li>It’s an empowering big step to get the wearable to understand more about your current health, but it’s the follow-through on changing habits where it matters</li>
<li>Biofeedback aid &#8211; using these tools to intuitively understand our body better, such as the live of intensity we should be working out (eg running at a certain heart rate and being true to that based on what you’ve learned from a heart rate monitor)</li>
<li>Phil mentions that it can be hard for people to stick to a strict heart rate without the HR monitor (instead we get too wrapped up in no pain no gain)</li>
<li>How it’s changing these days with all our workout data such as power and heart rate info being available on a public platform, eg Strava, Zwift, etc.</li>
<li>Measuring your submit efforts is an important part of overall fitness assessment with the gold-standard being a MAF test</li>
<li>MAF test and focusing on this component of fitness is a good marker of our overall state of health and wellness (not just speed and fitness)</li>
<li>Phi Maffetone: Wearables for an assessment is valuable but not for ongoing, regular use</li>
<li>Don’t use devices as a game or part of an unhealthy obsession<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
<li>KEY POINT: Get to the point where you don’t need to use them anymore</li>
<li>Using wearables to set healthy boundaries for ourselves</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Phil&#8217;s daily practices for ongoing wellbeing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Phil shares some of his personal routines or practices for self-care and wellbeing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
<li>5-minute power breaks: alpha wave exercise; going into a type of meditation mindset</li>
<li>daydreaming, lying, eyes closed, etc. Having the power to “click into” this state is crucial for health and balancing the autonomic nervous system</li>
<li>Do it at least twice a day</li>
<li>use it when you need it to counteract a stressful moment or to recharge the brain.</li>
<li>Frequency when it comes to meditation or power breaks is most important, because consistently training the brain is key to reaping the benefits</li>
<li>Alpha vs theta vs delta states</li>
<li>Sleeping habits</li>
<li>The caution against using devices to monitor sleep—why they do more harm than good for sleep quality</li>
<li>Using wearables nightly for sleep is something that Phil does not see as necessary and that it also may retract from your best sleep<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
<li>Not that they should be off limits, but just use periodically and for a greater purpose and not as a gamer or competition with yourself</li>

<h2><b>Peter asks:</b></h2>
<p><b>&#8220;Get those glutes firing?&#8221;</b></p>
<div>
<p>Hello Endurance Planet Fam!</p>
<div>What are Lucho&#8217;s favorite workouts to activate and strengthen the glutes. I got a weak ass!!</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What the coaches say:</h3>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>There is a big difference between activation and strength</li>
<li>Activating glutes would include anything dynamic (i.e., deep squat jump, walking lunges)
<ul>
<li>Dynamic vs. Nondynamic
<ul>
<li>Dynamic implies explosion</li>
<li>A nondynamic example would be a squat without the jump</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It&#8217;s hard to strengthen the glutes without activating other muscles (e.g., hamstrings, quads, hip flexors)</li>
<li>Bands are useful for activation</li>
<li>Specific examples that Lucho uses to target his glutes:
<ul>
<li>Powerband around his knees with a wide-stance squat</li>
<li>Donkey kicks</li>
<li>High elevated glute bridges with a powerband</li>
<li>20 lbs ankle weighted donkey kicks</li>
<li>Walking lunges, Bulgarian split squats, and RDLs</li>
<li>More examples from the coaches: banded monster walks and side step-ups (watch the patella tendon)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>True glute power would include heavy-loaded glute brides with an Olympic bar</li>
<li>Low back pain or tight hips are signs of glute weakness
<ul>
<li>Work on range of motion through the hips</li>
<li>Start with gentle moves (e.g., bridges)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h2><b>Aamir N. asks:</b></h2>
<p><b>&#8220;All the time to train &#8212; how to approach MAF?&#8221;</b></p>
<div>Hey, I am a big fan of your podcast and have been following MAF for a while now. I have a question regarding training. I currently have all the time in the world to train. My time permits me to just train and sleep all day without any problem. If i am following MAF, I need some help to design an optimum plan for Ironman distance triathlon for a time rich athlete. As i mentioned that time is not a problem for me, I would like to train high volume (20 hours + ). I would be grateful if you help me out with a high volume Ironman plan usin MAF. Thanks a lot!!!!</div>

<h3>What the coaches say:</h3>
</div>
<ul>
<li>What sport is your weakness? Make that your priority.</li>
<li>Start at a very manageable load.</li>
<li>If you have unlimited time, don&#8217;t try to fill it with training. What did the past 3 years look like in regards to training? Start with where you are.</li>
<li>Because you have time, you can gradually and intelligently add volume</li>
<li>You want one month of ~40 good workouts. Don&#8217;t get the most out of <em>every</em> workout.</li>
<li>Pay attention to data, how you feel, and listening to your body.</li>
<li>For runs, increase frequency, not necessarily duration.</li>
<li>An appropriate long bike ride would be anything over your race distance.</li>
<li>Use the winter as a time to focus on a different area.</li>
<li>The coaches encourage you to listen to more resources from Dr. Phil Maffetone, and really learn how to listen to your body.</li>
<li>Put limits to your training.</li>
<li>Build confidence by starting out with a manageable load.</li>
<li>Consistency over a long period of time is key.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<h2><b>Craig asks:</b></h2>
<p><b>&#8220;Libido drops when injured &#8211; why?&#8221;</b></p>
<div>
<div>Since we can talk about poop, periods and other personal issue here I was wondering how injury affects libido. Whenever I get injured my libido drops big time.  But shouldn&#8217;t it be the opposite?  If I&#8217;m not training as much shouldn&#8217;t I have more energy?  Or does not working out/training lower your hormone levels which include sex drivy hormones? Or is it that you are so miserable that that mood is what is affecting your hormones? And Lucho, hopefully next year your wife will let you put up Christmas lights as early as this sunny socal man! Thanks &amp; Happy New Year</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What the coaches say:</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you&#8217;re in a continuous sympathetic state (i.e., high stress) it can be more difficult to become aroused.</li>
<li>Talk to your doctor and check your hormones; test hormones (e.g., testosterone, DHT) when you&#8217;re completely rested.</li>
<li>Lifting weights is a testosterone booster.</li>
<li>Athletes are usually more in tune with their bodies.</li>

<p>Welcome to episode 24 of Holistic Performance Nutrition (HPN) featuring <a href="http://coachtawnee.com/">Tawnee Gibson</a>, MS, CSCS, CISSN, and Julie McCloskey, a certified holistic nutrition coach who you can find over at <a href="http://wildandwell.fit/">wildandwell.fit</a>.</p>
<p>On this episode:</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>New study: </strong>Randomized control trail &#8211; <a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/9000/Whole_Egg_Vs__Egg_White_Ingestion_During_12_weeks.94140.aspx">&#8220;Whole Egg Vs. Egg White Ingestion During 12 weeks of Resistance Training in Trained Young Males&#8221;</a>
<ul>
<li>Purpose: Compare the effects between whole eggs and egg white ingestion during 12 weeks of resistance training on body composition, muscular strength, and anaerobic power in resistance-trained young males. A secondary purpose was to examine systemic hormonal responses.</li>
<li>Motivation: Whey and casein are routinely used in exercise nutritional studies; however, it is relatively unknown what effects protein-based whole food products have on the physiological adaptations from RT. Whole eggs (containing yolk) are considered a high-quality protein food source because of their amino acid profile and their digestibility.</li>
<li>Sample size:
<ul>
<li>15 resistance-trained young males were randomly assigned to one of 2 groups</li>
<li>Group 1 &#8211; ate 3 whole eggs immediately after a resistance training session</li>
<li>Group 2 &#8211; ate 6 egg whites immediately after a resistance training session</li>
<li>12 weeks of whole-body undulating periodized resistance training 3 sessions per week</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tested: Knee extensor muscle mass, lean body mass and body fat percentage, muscular strength (knee extension, handgrip strength), Wingate (cycle ergometer), and serum concentrations of hormones were assessed.</li>
<li>Conclusion: Postexercise whole egg ingestion increases knee extension and handgrip strength, testosterone, and reduces body fat percentage compared with postexercise egg white ingestion, despite no group differences in muscle mass, in resistance-trained young males. <b>Therefore, whole egg ingestion may be preferable if increasing muscular strength or improving body fat percentage is </b><b>the focus during a RT program.</b></li>
<li>Why they think this was the conclusion: Calories, cholesterol, and micronutrients! Egg yolks contain various nonprotein components that may modulate the anabolic response, such as vitamins, minerals, phosphatidic acid, palmitic acid, DHA, and micro RNAs. Other nutrients ingested with protein will influence the nitrogen utilization of the protein intake.  On a whole-body level in resting subjects, incorporation of dietary nitrogen into peripheral proteins was highest when fat was ingested concurrently. Dietary cholesterol, independent of total daily protein intake, was positively associated with RT gains in muscle performance. Potentially, the higher cholesterol and saturated fatty acid intake (in the egg yolk) may have modulated the serum testosterone concentration changes.</li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Kat B. asks:</b></h2>
<h3><b>Paleo-based endurance nutrition</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hi Tawnee and Julie,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you so much for all of the work the two of you do as well as the entire Endurance Planet Team.  Over a year ago I was diagnosed with a GI based autoimmune disease (ulcerative colitis) and I have been working with a functional medicine doctor to get to the root cause and am finally back to feeling like myself and almost symptom free.  Given the craziness of 2020 I was furloughed from my job, and headed out to CA to spend some time with my parents.  I took my bike with me but left my HR monitor at home (by accident). I focused on listening to my body, riding when it felt right, I took the time to enjoy rides with friends and ditch my competitive nature most days.  My rides were based more on time than mileage, and it really helped me to find my love of cycling again.  Due to my IBD I currently follow a paleo based diet, and find that grains and high sugars cause me to flare up and I feel sluggish for a few days.  I want to get back to riding longer distances, as well as returning to Ironman training but I seem to be hitting a bit of a wall with the nutrition component.  I know that nutrition has always been my weak point.  I was in RED-S after my ironman, my periods were almost gone, I had an ankle fracture 6 months after finishing, my IBD was getting worse and most of the doctors I saw just wrote me off (that&#8217;s a whole other story).  I really want to work back in a smart way, but I am finding it difficult to navigate the world of portable nutrition that is not overly packed with sugar or grains.  As of right now I tend to eat RX bars or lara bars when on the bike or trails, but on some of my longer rides I end up with sugar fatigue, and feel supper foggy the next day.  Just wondering if you have any suggestions for good nutrition sources when riding or running for a paleo based athlete.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you again for all of your help and great advice!</span></p>
<h3><strong>What the coaches say:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD) as a resource for “safe” carb sources and other fuel choices. From their website:</span>
<ul>
<li>Avoid anything with these:<span style="font-weight: 400;"> agave, spirulina, amaranth, arrowroot, barley, buckwheat, most beans/bean products, NO GUM, chocolate, corn, dextrose, sprouted grain breads, FOS (read labels), fructose (as in added fructose in commercial products), guar gum, gums, hemp, inositol, inulin, maple syrup, millet, molasses, oats, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, natural peanut butter, Pectin (check labels on jams, jellies), plantains, whey protein powders, quinoa, rice, seaweed, seed butters/flours, all things soy, sweet potatoes, wheat, xantham gum, yams, yucca, </span></li>
<li>Ok to use: almonds/almond flour+ butter, apples, avocado, bacon, bananas, berries, brazil nuts, butter, butternut suqash, cashews, aged cheese, everything from coconuts, cranberry juice, dates (but not date sugar), eggs, ghee, ginger, grape juice, grapes, homemade SCD yogurt, honey, mac nuts, meats (Epic bar?), melon, homemade orange juice, some aged cheeses in moderation but not processed cheese, peanuts and PB, canned fruit in own juice no sugar added, raisins in moderation, saccharine, walnuts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Danielle Walker’s Against All Grain recipes: </span><a href="https://againstallgrain.com/category/recipes/scd-recipes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://againstallgrain.com/category/recipes/scd-recipes/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">As much as you can do so, make homemade nutrition! (e.g., Grain-free, sugar-free banana bread.)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">*UCAN &#8211; Being a corn-derived starch fuel source, but also a special unique low glycemic carb to manage blood sugar, Tawnee was curious if there’s any evidence of UCAN either aggravating symptoms or helping IBD athletes. Tawnee reached out to UCAN and received a couple of anecdotal reports:</span>
<ul>
<li>From a young high-level triathlete (just accepted his pro card):
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCAN started in 2013 for him. 2011 and 2012 he was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. Couldn&#8217;t find anything that worked for him. Stuff he was using before was really bothering him and making it worse. Tried GU, Hammer, a whole bunch of things. Worked with sports nutritionist &#8211; Dr. Krista Austin. UCAN is not the only thing he consumes during workouts, but pretty close to it. The ulcerative colitis is under control now. UCAN before the race, before a long run or long rides. &#8220;With colitis, I can&#8217;t eat a ton of stuff before.&#8221; UCAN does a decent job of being a meal replacement. </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Here&#8217;s another example from someone who only just recently started using UCAN after we had a conversation about how it might help her with her colitis:
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am loving the UCAN products!!! I have been using the protein drink every morning before my training. I&#8217;ve noticed a HUGE difference in my energy levels during the day plus way less stomach issues&#8230; overall a massive win so far. In addition, I&#8217;ve noticed I&#8217;m less grumpy after long days (big win especially for the husband)Also the UCAN carb drink for runs seems to be working really well. My husband and I went hunting over the weekend which included a ton of hiking plus my daily run miles. UCAN made it possible. I couldn&#8217;t eat much at hunt camp because of the flare-up but I could rely on UCAN for energy.&#8221;</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Y<span style="font-weight: 400;">ou don’t want to push the sugar intake since that is contributing to inflammation. You need to change the way you train now that you have a diagnosis and a way of eating that you know is benefitting your body. Think about the long game, don’t push the sugar and grains just to hit a PR or extend an already long ride &#8212; try to find your sweet spot that combines everything you love about ironman and keeping your health solid</span></li>
<li>Hire a health coach or sports nutritionist to help you navigate the complexities.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Bri asks:</b></h2>
<h3><b>Help me figure out the right tests to heal my messed up gut! </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hi gals,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have some major gut issues that I suspect might be something related to SIBO, candida, leaky gut, maybe even IBS?—who knows!— but when I talked to my doctor, they wanted to send me straight to a gastroenterologist for an endoscopy and colonoscopy. I hear you often talk about functional stool tests like GI MAP, which I’ve browsed online and what seems to be what functional medicine doctors recommend. However all that looks very expensive and not covered by my insurance unlike the gastro and those tests which will be covered. So can you explain to me if I am wasting my time with an endoscopy and colonoscopy for my issues? Or is there value to these tests in the quest to diagnose gut dysbiosis and figure out a healing plan. What are the differences? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, second question: I was prescribed a PPI some time ago for reflux, and some of my (amateur) research online is now leading me to believe this may be doing more harm than good for my gut issues. Can you elaborate if I am onto something here?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Background: I am 33 years old, longtime runner now turned ultra runner. I also do some CrossFit on the side. I don’t have an eating disorder, and feel like I have a healthy relationship with food, but I am very stressed with life stuff and more so this year with COVID—and as a result my gut symptoms are a lot worse, which is why I’m reaching out for some expertise. After (sometimes even during) my run workouts I have pretty bad loose stools or diarrhea, undigested. (Sorry TMI!) I also feel bloated a lot of the time especially after eating. I am worried that I stay so lean because I am not digesting food that well (5’6 125lbs) and quite frankly sometimes I feel like I”m wasting money buying high-quality meats and organic produce! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am willing to invest in my health in 2021…. so if you think I do need these stool tests and a functional doctor I am ready to budget for that and get this figured out, because at this point, it’s just making life miserable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for any advice and any directions you can point me in.</span></p>
<h3><strong>What the coaches say:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Endo/Colon: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Not a bad idea to do it if insurance covers it. Good to check the box on these and make sure nothing abnormal is found. But if nothing comes back as being wrong, yet you have symptoms, don’t give up! These tests do not show everything and often you need to go deeper, on a more microscopic level, with the functional labs. </span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endoscopy: CAMERA goes through the stomach and the beginning of the small intestine. Endoscopy will miss candida and SIBO for example. The endoscopy doesn&#8217;t tell us too much about the microbial ecosystem in the small intestine.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colonoscopy: Also a CAMERA to view the inside. Things like colon cancer screening, tissue changes + a lot of prep like clearing your bowels the whole day prior. </span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">These tests can show some stuff like: c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eliac, h. pylori infection, gastritis (stomach inflammation), gastroenteritis (inflammation intestine), ulcers, polyps (abnormal growths of tissue projecting from the colon wall), colon cancer, and esophagitis. </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endo/Colon does not detect microbial infections, dysbiosis, etc. — basically what is GROWING in your microbiome on a MICROSCOPIC level. </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The stool testing difference:
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do these tests look for? </span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digestive function. How is gut working, absorption, etc. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intestinal Inflammation.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immune function. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State of microbiome (ecosystem). What’s living in there, who’s living in there, how many of them are living in there (both good &amp; bad guys), imbalances, etc. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Infections and pathogenic organisms that may be present. </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conditions:</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just a short list: Chronic low B12, skin conditions, autoimmune conditions, food intolerances, etc… all these can be addressed via gut stool test. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chronic constipation and/or diarrhea, also run a SIBO breath test. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hashimotos, you really should check on candida as they often go hand in hand. Candida (yeast/fungi) overgrowth is super tricky to detect and heal. </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GI MAP </span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a qPCR test, confirms the presence of DNA material for each tested microorganism + assigns a quantity. </span>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(This is similar to the current COVID PCR test—detects RNA genetic information even in extremely small amounts.)</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With GI MAP, if certain markers grow to pathogenic or opportunistic levels this can lead to clinical symptoms and chronic inflammation.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">So a GI MAP, in theory, can help pinpoint the ROOT cause of one or multiple of the following: </span>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(acute) nausea, vomiting, loose stools, bleeding, mucus, abdominal pain; </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(chronic) gastritis, bloating, constipation, abdominal discomfort, belching, gas, chronic bad breath and undigested food in the stools.</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GI MAP also looks at *healthy* flora and if those are low that can contribute to imbalances. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Example of markers on GI MAP and/or GI Effects: </span>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Cal Protectin<span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; inflammation measure, helps with assessing whether Chrons/Colitis (i.e. IBD) vs. IBS; autoimmune component, cancer risk, and so forth. Cal Protectin ranges shed insight of certain risks.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Secretory IgA<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; immune defense, if this is low more likely to have problems. (I often see low in athletes who aren’t feeling well.)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Anti-gliadin<span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; gluten sensitivity or celiac risk </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Elastase-1<span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; pancreatic enzyme; “marker for identifying pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. Clinical indications for assessing PE1 include diarrhea; weight loss or other possible symptoms of maldigestion; diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome; diabetes; celiac disease or other malabsorption disorders; cystic fibrosis; aging; low bone density; inflammatory bowel disease; obesity; and gallstones”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Lactobacillus/bifido<span style="font-weight: 400;">  &#8211; the good &#8220;guys&#8221; we want in abundance especially athletes. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Short-chain fatty acids<span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">product </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of colonic bacterial degradation </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of unabsorbed starch and non-starch in food (fiber). The primary </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fuel for a healthy microbiome, e.g. Butyrate a primary energy source for colonocytes </span></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why stool testing with a functional doc/health coach can really get you far:</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the severity, healing the gut could take several phases including test, re-test, and adjusting supplements. You want to work with someone who will be by your side on this journey!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going the functional route with a functional med doc is usually going to land you into a more holistic assessment and protocol with more of a whole-body approach and natural healing protocol with herbal supplements and vitamins rather than prescription meds/pharmaceuticals. Meds have their place when necessary and indicated, but things like dysbiosis and imbalances can often be healed without the use of Rx that could introduce side effects. </span></li>
</ul>

<li>Reasons why stomach acid may be low:
<ul>
<li>Chris Kresser&#8217;s article <a href="https://chriskresser.com/how-to-cure-gerd-without-medication/">How to Cure GERD without Medication</a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eating too fast, distracted, in a stressed-out state. </span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sight, smell, anticipation, and chewing of food</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High Stress</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The release of HCL depends on the stimulation by the parasympathetic nervous system</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If SNS is on it shunts blood away from the whole digestive tract, stomach and intestines both</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chronic overeating or eating one huge meal a day</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will exhaust the pancreas eventually</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NSAID/medication use</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">H Pylori flourishes in this environment, and it further lowers stomach acid. Even worse heartburn and GERD symptoms</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How to increase stomach acid: Where to go from here?
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reduce stress &#8211; 3 slow deep breaths before eating</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chew!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acid: Betaine HCL, with pepsin</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">600mg &#8212; if it doesn&#8217;t produce a warming sensation take one more and continue to increase the amount until you feel the warming sensation</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zinc</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The production of HCL depends on sodium and zinc</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DGL &#8211; deglycyrrhizinated licorice after every meal and before bed</span>

<li>Pushups, form &amp; shoulder health
<ul>
<li>We&#8217;ve had a lot of people write in about doing burpees these days but also people with &#8220;questionable&#8221; shoulder health so let&#8217;s discuss a few basics to be mindful of when doing push-ups, especially those with or prone to impingement. Here is one article to reference with video and blog that has great cues: <a href="http://www.yorkvillephysiotherapy.com/video-blog/pub:38/Shoulder-impingement-rehab-via-pushup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.yorkvillephysiotherapy.com/video-blog/pub:38/Shoulder-impingement-rehab-via-pushup&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1607789017161000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGFTu1ozh6B2ng7GVcw-OOMUmdiwQ">http://www.<wbr />yorkvillephysiotherapy.com/<wbr />video-blog/pub:38/Shoulder-<wbr />impingement-rehab-via-pushup</a></li>
<li>Pushup modifications: Knee pushups may not be the best at preparing you to do a pushup the correct way. The incline pushup is a superior modification because it is more specific to the muscle recruitment needed to do a regular pushup.</li>
<li>Having elbows out at 90 degrees is not proper form; you want them to be around 60 degrees.</li>

<h2><b>Jason asks:</b></h2>
<div><b>Longest brick before IM?</b></div>
<div>
<p>Happy Holidays! COVID sucks! Y&#8217;all rock! I&#8217;m catching up on shows now that I&#8217;m commuting again. Also, now that my deployment to the Middle East is cancelled, I&#8217;m registered for IMFL&#8217;21! Here&#8217;s my question: for the recreational, just want to &#8216;complete with a smile&#8217; type triathlete (in the past, ~14-15 hour finish time), what&#8217;s the longest brick you recommend before an IM and how many weeks before the race would you attempt it? Thanks! Keep on being awesome!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What the coaches say:</h3>
<ul>
<li>At some point, doing more isn&#8217;t better. For an athlete that has done multiple Ironmans, they can get away with doing shorter brick workouts.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re 20 to 25 weeks out, why not do a one-hour bike ride and then a 15-16 mile run; this will mentally prepare you for later on in training.</li>
<li>4-8 weeks prior to the race, you could do a long bike workout followed by an hour run. Or you can do a short bike followed by a long run. You can also replace volume with &#8220;intensity.&#8221;</li>
<li>Take your average weekly training, and add 50% of that to your final peak phase (before your taper).</li>
<li>Practice nutrition.</li>
<li>Mimic meals similar to what you&#8217;ll have the night before the race.</li>
<li>Nutrition on the bike is going to affect your run.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2><b>Mike asks:</b></h2>
<div><b>Training for IM + BQ Hopes</b></div>
<div>
<p>I’ve just started listening to the show since April and love it.  So much good advice that applies to so many people.  Like many, my year was a bit messed up due to Covid 19. In Spring I was scheduled for IM Tulsa. Obviously halfway through training, the race was cancelled and moved to 2021.  I am somewhat questioning even if that will go.  Since April this year I have mainly been focused on running, which is my favorite of the three sports.  August was able to run a trail 50k. September ran a last man standing and 38.5. October did a 12-hour timed race and ran 42 miles in 9 hours.  Stopped at 9 because I felt good and wanted to continue to feel good. And then in November I will run a 50 miler, trying for under 10 but a finish would make me happy. Plan is to start swimming after Thanksgiving and <u>get back on my bike for IM Tulsa 2021 which  is at the end of May</u>.  Have not done much of either since April. However, the main goal originally for 2021 was to BQ at a November race. I love running and I use triathlon for the crosstraining and I believe it has helped me become more durable.</p>
<p>Background….. I am 49 and turn 50 in March. 6&#8242; and 180.  I am a long time runner (40 years).  Ran some marathons in my 20’s.  Ran sub 4 but nothing special.  Did not really know much about maximizing training and nutrition back then.  Ran in my 30’s but no racing until late 30’s then suffered my first injury when I was 42 (IT Band).  Since then it still crops up occasionally. Could not run as much as I want from 42-45 so finally decided to start biking and swimming.  Did Ironman Boulder in 2018 and suffered through the heat.  Temps got over a 100.  Time was 15:40. Triathlon, PT and training smarter has helped me become more durable with my running, as the IT Band does not bother me as much.  My goal for IM Tulsa was to knock a couple hours off of the Boulder time. The Boulder race was all about preserving energy just to finish so was very conservative since it was my first Ironman. Last year I ran a 5:47 mile, 19:48 5k, 1:37 half marathon.  Since the Pandemic and finding the show I have been cutting back on speed work getting ready for the ultras that I have been doing this fall. My MAF is usually around 8:30 – 8:45 and I use a range of 120-135. So my times have come up a little, still a sub 6 mile and a sub 21 5k.  These are solo TT times. Not a strong cyclist or swimmer. IM swim is around 1:20, and bike around 15-17mph for an IM race.</p>
<p>Finally a Question….</p>
<p><b>How can I structure my Ironman Training in early 2021/ spring to complete Ironman but also set myself up for the BQ attempt in November?</b></p>
<p>My structure for IM Training is as follows. 2 bikes – 1 interval or tempo ride and 1 long, swim – interval/tempo and 1 long. 3 runs – 1 interval, 1 tempo, 1 long.  Sometimes I include extra biking because I feel it is my weakest.  Both bikes have a short brick usually as well. I know speed work for running is not necessary for IM trainng but I enjoy it. My goal for the BQ training was to establish volume through Jun/July and then 16 week program following the 3 key workouts of 1 interval/1 tempo / and 1 long run. So should I do more long runs than what a typical IM plan would have? Or don’t change much and just turn my focus to the BQ in June…..is it enough time?  Any thoughts and advice are greatly appreciated. Thanks for all you guys do.</p>
<div dir="ltr">
<h3>What the coaches say:</h3>
</div>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Post-Tulsa, maintain movement and active recovery.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The first week after the race, you will want to get in the pool. In the second week, start biking. After the end of that second week, do a 2-3 mile jog. If you&#8217;re feeling good after all that, you can start training again.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Don&#8217;t rush back into hardcore training; give yourself a true rest break.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The coaches recommended Joel Friel&#8217;s philosophy for the periodization and Jack Daniel&#8217;s philosophy for the running.</li>

Steve is a holistic alternative health care doctor who runs a practice in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Learn more about his practice at <a href="https://www.drgangemi.com">drgangemi.com</a> and visit his many resources at <a href="https://sock-doc.com/">sock-doc.com</a>.</p>
<p>On this episode:</p>

<li>The Sock Doc wears <a href="https://xeroshoes.com/?gc_id=1056237749&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAtqL-BRC0ARIsAF4K3WFvuf-nig4MHvxLZw398pJBT0eKpCOIdtQ-QKzNNfqP_MElEYFcBv0aAgZsEALw_wcB">Xero Shoes</a> for his trail runs</li>
<li>Adrenal fatigue may not be the best term to use
<ul>
<li>But if you have pain, inflammation, fatigue, or endocrine-type problems, it is probably affecting your adrenal glands</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hans Selye&#8217;s concept of biological stress
<ul>
<li>General Adaptation Syndrome</li>
<li>Eustress means beneficial or &#8220;good&#8221; stress</li>
<li>Distress means negative or &#8220;bad&#8221; stress</li>
<li>Certain stresses can affect the adrenal glands</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the Sock Doc&#8217;s practice, he&#8217;s seen that the adrenal glands are typically secondary issues (rather than the primary issue)</li>
<li>Adrenal fatigue is an intricate problem; theoretically, it actually stems from the brain (HPA axis)
<ul>
<li>&#8220;H&#8221; in HPA stands for the hypothalamus</li>
<li>&#8220;P&#8221; stands for pituitary
<ul>
<li>The brain, to the pituitary, to the adrenals</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adrenal glands are circadian rhythm-based
<ul>
<li>Ideally, the adrenal glands are secreting the most amount of cortisol between 6 to 8 am with a big drop off at 12 pm, then slowly dwindles down</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you push yourself too hard &#8211; mentally, physically, emotionally &#8211; most likely you have an ailment telling yourself you&#8217;re pushing too hard</li>
<li>Your feet are a great representation of your health</li>

<h2><b>Maggie asks:</b></h2>
<p><b>Mom of 4, Need help with core!</b></p>
<p>Hi guys, I recently started listening to your podcast the past couple weeks after I signed up for an Ironman 70.3.  I’ve always been fairly athletic but I’ve been busy with having babies and my career.  My kids are currently 10,8,4 and 2 and I had c sections with all of them.  I’ve always had pretty strong abs but I’m sure my core is pretty whacked after having kids.  After having to telework with my four kids at home during Covid, I decided I needed to do something for myself hence the jump into an Ironman.  My question is, what core exercises should I be doing to improve my running posture and swimming and how often?  After hearing Lawrence van Lingen on your podcast, I started following him and his exercises as well.  Thank you for any advice you may have!</p>
<h3>What the coaches say:</h3>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Listen to these past shows:
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Consciously work on correcting your posture and having the strength to support it. How is your posture when you&#8217;re not running? Don&#8217;t worry about running posture until you fix your posture outside of sport.</li>
<li>First: ASSESSMENT
<ul>
<li>DR (diastasis recti): Greater than 2-finger width separation or there is a bulge at the linea alba, a DR is present. Be sure to also note the depth of the DR.</li>
<li>Stress urinary incontinence</li>
<li>Ribcage &#8211; widened? flared out? Can your ribcage stay in place when your arms move (e.g., holding an arm width foam roller arms sticking straight out to overhead)?</li>
<li>Unnaturally tucking pelvis and gripping buttocks to overcompensate and attempt to stabilize?</li>
<li>Postural changes: Increased laxity from hormones during pregnancy/breastfeeding result in postural changes including:
<ul>
<li>increased flaring of the rib cage</li>
<li>increased lumbar</li>
<li>lordosis</li>
<li>increased thoracic kyphosis</li>
<li>anterior pelvic rotation</li>
<li>widening of the pelvis</li>
<li>flattening of feet</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Core strength is not about having six-pack abs; it&#8217;s about how the inner workings of the transverse abdominous, diaphragm, pelvic floor, and the psoas major (the things we cannot see).</li>
<li>Second: BREATHING
<ul>
<li>How is your breathing? That is at the foundation and teaches you how to activate and function well.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Exercises to improve posture:
<ul>
<li>An example of a specific exercise to do for running posture: Sit on your butt with your legs in front of you and move your arms really fast, exactly how you would in running (this forces your posture to come into alignment)</li>
<li>Jumping rope</li>
<li>Use a variety of open- and closed-chain exercises</li>
<li>Work in multiple planes of motion</li>
<li>Use loaded and unloaded conditions</li>
<li>Use stable and unstable positions</li>
<li>Work unilateral and bilateral (e.g., single-leg deadlifts)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While there is no magical set of exercises, but some basic core exercises can include:
<ul>
<li>Bird dog</li>
<li>Bridges</li>

<h2><b>Megan asks:</b></h2>
</div>
<div dir="ltr"><b>Training for SoCal Ragnar (fingers crossed it happens!)</b></div>
<div dir="ltr">
<p>Hi endurance planet!</p>
<p>I hope the fall is treating you all well! Quick ATC questions…pending Ragnar Socal 2021 occurs…what the best way to train? The leg(s) I’m expecting are 20-21 miles in total broken up into 3 runs. 34 (almost 35yo Female). Stats are basic: marathon times 3-3:10, half around 1:30, 5k 19ish, 4miler (my stronger of the short runs) around 24. I’m used to running doubles most days and peaked my MAF run volumes this fall for constant 70-80+ mile easy run weeks (rescued a Siberian husky to help!). I’m not deloading from the volume with the hopes of putting together a strong build to April 9. Suggestions? Course specific work? I live in the Cincinnati/Northern KY area &#8211; we have a lot of bridges and some hills but not anything gnarly like Colorado. Last piece is fueling- to be honest Im really fat adapted and have run several marathons 3:00-3:10 on just water and grit to finish. I can appreciate in a race like this I might benefit from a fueling strategy. I do have a jar of unopened UCAN (lol).</p>
</div>
<h3 dir="ltr">What the coaches say:</h3>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Our 2015 Ragnar Recap episode (link below) goes into detail on training, nutrition, race plan/pacing and more!

</ul>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">Fat adaptation is not a reason to not fuel for these events. Fueling benefits performance.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Eat the biggest portion of your food right after the run.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Keep hydrated.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Enjoy the experience!</li>
<li dir="ltr">Training wise: You don&#8217;t have to change anything.</li>
<li dir="ltr">A good 10k training program would be perfect; it would address volume and speed.</li>
<li dir="ltr">You might want to lean towards dropping volume and mixing in different types of intensity until ~10 weeks out.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The racecourse is not flat.</li>
<li dir="ltr">In the final 8 weeks before, brush up on steep downhill training.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Bring enough warm clothes.</li>

<div dir="ltr"><b>How to improve as a cyclist&#8230;. from running?</b></div>
<div dir="ltr">
<p>I&#8217;m a longtime fan of the show. I&#8217;ve adapted my training/racing countless times from new information and ideas discussed on the podcast. Thank you! For 2021, my focus will be racing mountain bikes with the goal &#8220;A&#8221; race being the Breck Epic Stage Race, which features six days of racing over a total of 240 miles and 40,000 feet of climbing. I&#8217;ll have several other &#8220;B&#8221; and &#8220;C&#8221; races including gravel, cyclocross, and mountain bike, but I&#8217;d also like to be able to hop into some local trail running races (mostly 10Ks). Question&#8230; How, when, and what type of runs can I incorporate into my cycling specific training plan that keeps me competitive in shorter trail runs and also benefits my overall cycling progression? My Breck Epic preparation will follow a model of Prep, Base 1-3, Build 1-2, Peak.</p>

<div>Which days of the week could I add some running? Should the runs be bricks or keep them seperate? What type of runs (hill repeats, track intervals, tempo, etc.) would have the most direct benefit to mountain biking? Do I need to reduce the running during the Build phases prior to the Breck Epic? PS I have nearly 15 years of endurance training and racing including everything from Ironman, 100-mile ultramarathons, and 200-mile bike races. Looking forward to hearing your expertise.</div>
</div>
<div></div>
<h3>What the coaches say:</h3>
<ul>
<li>For now, your run intensity should match your bike intensity to exploit the most out of your base training.</li>
<li>3 weight sessions a week is plenty of intensity.</li>
<li>In the prep phase, you should do easy running.</li>
<li>Tuesday could be an easy 3-mile run.</li>
<li>On Monday you could add a run <strong>before</strong> the bike (always put the run before the bike).</li>
<li>During Build 1, 2, and Peak, the running needs to shift.</li>
<li>You have a ton of time. Don&#8217;t extend the Base 1-3 out to 10 weeks each. Skew towards Base 1 or 2.</li>
<li>Thursday or Monday could be your long run day (e.g., steep hill repeats and tempos).</li>
<li>Running doesn&#8217;t directly help you be a better cyclist.</li>
<li>Weight training should include periodization as well.</li>
<li>Christopher Kelly took an all MAF approach for the BC Bike Race.</li>
<li>Have benchmarks for yourself.</li>
<li>Take a 10k program (the quality days) and mesh it into your training.</li>
<li>If you have to compromise a session, have it be your weights.</li>
<li>Do a double periodization since you have so much time.</li>

<p>Welcome to episode 23 of Holistic Performance Nutrition (HPN) featuring <a href="http://coachtawnee.com/">Tawnee Gibson</a>, MS, CSCS, CISSN, and Julie McCloskey, a certified holistic nutrition coach who you can find over at <a href="http://wildandwell.fit/">wildandwell.fit</a>.</p>
<p>On this episode:</p>
<h2><b>Intro:</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tawnee &amp; Julie discuss Tawnee’s recent InsideTracker blood test with her InnerAge 2.0 results &#8211; a brief analysis of findings by Tawnee and Julie.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2291230/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://blog.insidetracker.com/muscle-damange-to-blame-for-elevated-liver-enzymes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this Inside Tracker blog</span></a> as it relates to elevated levels of AST and ALT (liver enzymes) in those who exercise heavily. Did Tawnee&#8217;s difficult weight workout affect her results? Other factors with AST and ALT, and also the importance of looking at trends (and what Tawnee&#8217;s trends show over the past 10+ years of blood tests).
<ul>
<li>Inside Tracker is recommending her AST be 10-24 and ALT 6-16.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does a slightly high creatine kinase (CK) also support the too-hard exercise theory? </span>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Physical exercise or strenuous sporting activities can increase blood creatine kinase (CK) levels… CK levels respond to marked changes in the amount and intensity of exercise. Thus, CK levels may increase significantly after unusual and eccentric types of exercise. This primarily applies to strength and speed-strength exercise stress (</span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4904530/#R4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)&#8230;. Marked increases in CK activity in the blood are often associated with an increase in aminotransferases; here, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST)—because of its higher muscular activity—shows a stronger response compared with glutamic pyruvate transaminase (GPT)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) remains unchanged (</span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4904530/#R3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).” Source: </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4904530/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4904530/</span></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) vs AST/ALT as cited in the <a href="https://blog.insidetracker.com/muscle-damange-to-blame-for-elevated-liver-enzymes">Inside Tracker blog</a>: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While GGT is more specific to overall liver health … ALT and AST are also found in significant quantities in skeletal muscles. When muscle is damaged, such as in response to exercise, AST and ALT are released from the  muscle and their concentration in the blood increases … </span><a href="https://blog.insidetracker.com/stressed-out-cortisol-creatine-kinase-play-big-roles"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Creatine Kinase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an enzyme found in our muscles, is another marker of muscle damage that follows the same pattern as AST and ALT after strenuous exercise.”</span></li>
<li>Why Tawnee is not worried about her cholesterol results:
<ul>
<li>Previous Endurance Planet episode on <a href="https://www.enduranceplanet.com/hpn-11-steps-to-healthy-cholesterol-levels-theories-for-increased-lipids-when-low-carb-and-are-those-non-nutritive-sweeteners-risky-or-not/">Steps to Healthy Cholesterol Levels</a></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bigger picture: Tawnee eats a super clean diet, her HDL:TG ratio is 1.09 (low risk is &lt;2), HDL is over 69 (over 50 ideal for women), CRP is &lt;1 (0.3), LDL:HDL ratio should be under 3:1 and hers is 1.8. No homocysteine on this test but last year it was 6.2 and &lt;7 is ideal. Also, Tawnee&#8217;s blood sugar levels/glycemic control this year have generally been fantastic. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">LDL-C doesn&#8217;t tell the whole story so Tawnee would want to look at LDL-P and apoB to understand more. LDL-C over 160 is considered high risk, hers was 130.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interesting from recent Robb Wolf&#8217;s podcast, Healthy Rebellion Radio: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“new paper.. </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really interesting machine learning looking at the relationships between LDL cholesterol and diabetes risk. People with low LDL are at an exceptionally higher risk for type 2 diabetes and poor glycemic control. Now, what wasn’t entirely clear was is having higher cholesterol levels protective of this? That wasn’t entirely sussed out, but it’s one of these things where we have this narrative where it’s like, “Oh, man, the lower the LDL cholesterol, the better,” and that’s not necessarily the case.” </span></i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tawnee&#8217;s InnerAge 2.0 is 31.6 (her biological age is 35.6). There are 14 markers are used to calculate inner age for females (18 markers for males). For females it includes:</li>

<h2><b>Adriana asks:</b></h2>
<h3><b>Planning your training (and nutrition) around a period</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have recovered from amenorrhea (thank you for your awesome advice, it definitely helped me along the way!) and now want to make sure my period stays healthy and normal, and that I can plan my training with my cycle to maximize my training with my hormones. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of note, I’m 29 years old, 5’5 135(ish) lbs, and it took awhile for my period to normalize but now it’s pretty steadily 26-28 days per cycle and I do feel worse in the 4-5 days before it starts. I’m mainly a runner but starting to get into more triathlon training — I’ve done plenty of marathons and not sure how long I’ll take it with triathlon but would like to eventually do an Ironman. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, I am not on any special diets but am wondering if there’s a style of eating that complements each phase of the menstrual cycle that you guys would recommend, like should we give into all the sweet/carb cravings before we start our period or would lower carb low sugar help alleviate PMS like symptoms?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for your work especially for the ladies out there!</span></p>
<h3>What the coaches say:</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">For starters, refer back to this EP podcast Tawnee recorded with Dr. Stacy Sims a number of years ago for a lot of wonderful, specific details and advice: <a href="https://www.enduranceplanet.com/stacy-sims-phd-the-everything-guide-for-female-athletes-how-to-navigate-your-menstrual-cycle-the-menopause-years-cortisol-and-stress-nutrition-needs-and-more/">The Everything Guide for Female Athletes &#8211; How to Navigate Your Menstrual Cycles, the menopause Years, Cortisol and Stress, Nutrition Needs, and More</a> </span></li>
<li>Primer on periods and phases: Follicular phase (Days 1 to ~14)
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low hormones. You feel stronger and exercise feels easier. Women also access carbs more easily during this time. A good time for HIIT. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Week 1: Anti-inflammatory foods to help with the added inflammation of menstrual week:</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fish, fruits, veg, nuts and seeds, herbs, ginger tea</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Week 2: Our extroverted, go get ‘em week! Can make some serious “gains” </span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An increase in protein would be beneficial to support your added intensities</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Luteal phase (Days ~14 to 28-40ish/end of cycle)
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build to the high-hormone phase, PMS, and generally not able to perform as well. Reduced reaction time, coordination off (hormonal related joint laxity). Women burn more calories during this time (5-10% increase in metabolism).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Progesterone is catabolic, and with both hormones high, it’s harder to access amino acids. So an increase in protein here would be helpful!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower total body sodium; be sure to preload your long workouts and salt your food!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Week 3:  Get in protein, especially before a workout. Go into workouts fueled. For the longer sessions, eat carbs during a workout. Eat more resistant starches to help with your gut bacteria and hopefully, alleviate any constipation that an increase in progesterone and estrogen can cause</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Week 4: PMS; hormones are at their peak. Avoid fried foods, processed foods, and anything that you know causes inflammation in your body. Increase antioxidant-rich foods and calories because you’re building a new organ (endometrial lining). </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watch for luteal phase defect (short second phase). This can be more common in endurance athletes and/or those who’ve recovered from amenorrhea and shows that progesterone levels may not be optimized, can be tied into overtraining, underfueling and/or other hormonal things like low thyroid. Source: </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12972877/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12972877/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are too many nuances to female physiology and cycle to draw blanket conclusions on how we should fuel. No one size fits all. And the research is rather inconclusive and/or contradictory and lacks the quality type of RCT that we want.</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><a href="https://www.intechopen.com/books/menstrual-cycle/menstrual-cycle-and-physical-effort"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite many years of interest in this subject, the current research does not allow to draw unambiguous conclusions about the impact of the changing level of sex hormones during individual phases of the menstrual cycle on the exercise capacity of women</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/japplphysiol.00774.2019?journalCode=jappl"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interesting new study showed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally occurring fluctuations in the sex hormones estrogen and progesterone does not affect the whole body PFO and FAT</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">max</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in young eumenorrheic women measured during a graded exercise test. The menstrual cycle phase does not affect the peak fat oxidation rate during a graded exercise test. Natural physiological fluctuations in estrogen do not increase peak fat oxidation rate. FAT</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">max</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is not influenced by the menstrual cycle phase in healthy, young eumenorrheic women.</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>What previous studies have shown:</b>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">That elevated estrogen increases the reliance on fat as oxidative fuel during endurance exercise and that progesterone counteracts that. Consistent studies have shown that whole-body fat oxidation was higher at submaximal intensities during ML compared to MF.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>What this study shows:</b>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, these findings are not supported in this study conducted in young women with naturally fluctuating sex hormones do not support these previous findings.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High hormone phase (luteal phase):</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional knowledge shows us that we have a harder time utilizing carbs/glucose so intensity may feel more difficult.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Higher oxidation of lipids and lower oxidation of carbohydrates in the luteal phase during submaximal efforts at an intensity higher than 50% VO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2max</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have also been demonstrated in other studies [</span><a href="https://www.intechopen.com/books/menstrual-cycle/menstrual-cycle-and-physical-effort#B61"><span style="font-weight: 400;">61</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.intechopen.com/books/menstrual-cycle/menstrual-cycle-and-physical-effort#B62"><span style="font-weight: 400;">62</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.intechopen.com/books/menstrual-cycle/menstrual-cycle-and-physical-effort#B63"><span style="font-weight: 400;">63</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">]. </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall recommendation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t overthink it&#8211;the main goal is to get in enough calories overall and not dip into prolonged periods without fuel (e.g. IF) and/or a chronic hypocaloric diet trap. This is always goal #1. Eat to train, don’t train to eat! </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Cheryl asks:</b></h2>
<h3><b>Gaining weight &amp; your period</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hello Tawnee and Julie! (Lucho won’t want this one. Sorry, Lucho)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for putting out high quality podcasts. I actually went back and listened to all of the ones I could find. I think I’ve picked up tidbits from all of them!   I really enjoy the addition of HPN and look forward to each new episode. That’s where my question is directed today. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m a 41 year old female competitive runner. I also dabble in IM and enjoy that at well.  For running, my main focus is the marathon, and my PR is 2:53. I love running fast endurance events. I work with an endurance coach and my training fluctuates between MAF, Daniels, and honestly probably every other method that’s out there. We keep it interesting. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, I haven’t menstruated since Dec 2017. I‘m 5’6” and currently weigh 110-112. My weight hovered between 120-125 for over a year and a half before I made a concerted effort to drop weight for my OT attempt. I did not menstruate when I was at 125 and obviously not now that I’m much lower. I have a few questions that I don’t think have been directly answered on the podcast before. If they have, I apologize and please point me to the correct show. </span></p>
<p><b>First, should I care that I haven’t menstruated? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve had multiple (probably around 5) DEXA scans since 2018 and my bone density is great. I keep monitoring it because I know that is one of the biggest concerns with not menstruating. I also have two beautiful children and am not looking to have anymore.  Also of note, is that I’m not hungry.  Getting down to this weight was a challenge, but now that I’m here it just feels natural. I get full and don’t want to eat anymore.  What else should I be concerned about? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rest of my questions are contingent upon the answer to the first. </span></p>
<p><b>If I should care, how do I begin to healthily gain weight?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, I greatly appreciate your podcasts and I’ve learned so much from all of them. Thank you for brightening my days and making all of us better athletes and humans. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>
<h3>What the coaches say:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Every woman wants to have their period; it is a great marker for overall health, energy, mood, cognition, sex drive, sleep, etc.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Higher levels of progesterone promote more restful sleep via an increase in GABA., also aids in lowering anxiety and restlessness</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low hormones also inhibit sleep quality, sexual health/libido, and can contribute to increased anxiety, stress, etc. Source: </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31403123/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31403123/</span></a></li>
<li>There are important potential long-term health complications to be aware of for women with amenorrhea; they include a higher predisposition to heart disease and cognitive diseases in later years of life.

<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good DEXA scan doesn’t necessarily mean that bone health is good, too. </span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Anya, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great to know that she does not currently have clinical osteopenia, but what we don&#8217;t know (maybe she does if she had a DEXA prior to the onset of amenorrhea) is the change in bone density that may have occurred. If she started with relatively higher T scores (Z scores are better when looking at bone density because it is matched to your age group, bone DEXA scans are read as standard deviations from the norm), then they may still look &#8220;normal&#8221; but the bone is not being remodeled optimally.&#8221;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They may look “normal” but her bones aren’t remodeling optimally. Most likely her estradiol is low which is needed to inhibit bone breakdown. Low estrogen, lots of bone breakdown</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you cannot eat more then you need to reduce your training.</li>
<li>You have to want it, and you have to go out of your way to make it happen. It will be uncomfortable.</li>

<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33009349/">Effects of Magnesium Supplementation on Muscle Soreness and Performance</a></p>
<p>&#8220;In this double-blind study, subjects were matched to a treatment group (Mg) (n 5 11) or a placebo (Pla) (n 5 11) group based off-dietary recall analyses. Subjects in the Mg group consumed 350 mg·d21 (total of 10 days) of Mg glycinate, whereas Pla consumed matched placebo (350 mg·d21 of maltodextrin).&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Before examining performance or perceptual responses, it is important to establish the Mg intake levels of the subjects. Results from dietary recall analyses indicated that only 2 of 22 individuals met or exceeded current gender- and age- specific RDA (males: 400 mg·d21, females: 310 mg·d21) (16) with 50% of subjects consuming less than 50% of current RDA (Table 1). <strong>The most important findings from this study were Mg significantly reduced muscle soreness and improved perceptual measures linked with performance and recovery</strong> (perceived recovery status). Actual performance approached significance for total RTF. In addition, although some subjects did not benefit, no subject responded negatively to Mg supplementation.&#8221;</p>
<h2><strong>David asks:</strong></h2>
<p>Hi, big fan of the show. I have a question for Lucho about clip on aero bars. We are currently looking at getting my wife a new aero road bike for cannondale.. The problem is the handle bars are shaped to be aero and have a flat profile instead of a typical round profile. This renders her clip on aero bars that she uses for the occasional triathlon useless. Do you know of any clip on aero bars or adapters that fit the new aero shaped handle bars that have been appearing on new bikes? Thanks for your help.</p>
<h3><strong>What the coaches say:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>There are no clip-ons specifically made for those bars.</li>
<li>The fit has to be really close because carbon bars can be too delicate for clamps.</li>
<li><a href="https://forum.slowtwitch.com/forum/Slowtwitch_Forums_C1/Triathlon_Forum_F1/Cannondale_system_six_clip_on_aero_bars%3F_P7021160/">Slowtwitch thread</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.giant-bicycles.com/us/contact-aero-clip-on-bar-clamp">Contact Aero Clip-On Bar Clamp</a> (specifically made for Giant&#8217;s aero bars)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The coaches recommend that you take it to a professional or get whole new bars.</li>
<li>Or, if your wife is an occasional triathlete don&#8217;t worry about the aero bars.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Shalane asks:</strong></h2>
<p>Hi Tawnee (and Lucho),</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a new listener to the podcast and am really liking it so far. I&#8217;ve got a COVID-era question for ask the coaches. I&#8217;m hoping that Lucho in particular may have some creative suggestions for this one. I’m curious to get your ideas on ways to accomplish speed work outside the gym during cold weather. I live in interior Alaska. It gets really cold here in the winter. That’s part of the reason I love living here, but it does present some unique challenges, especially now with the increased risk in occupying indoor public spaces. I have a background in rowing, running and Nordic skiing. The skiing is my primary sport, I do winter ultras in AK and the lower 48. In the summer I run and bike while in the winter it’s mostly skiing. Generally I’ll ski down to about -10F and then switch over to running when it gets colder because running is just easier for temperature regulation.</p>
<p>I like, and am with experienced with, outdoor exercise in the cold but doing sub-zero speed work is difficult for two reasons:<br />
1) Temperature regulation becomes difficult if your intensity is changing- You could carry extra layers to put on between intervals, but this means removing mitts and poles and stopping completely to take clothing on and off. Doesn’t sound like a big issue, but it’s a real PITA, can be dangerous and takes fartlek type stuff off the table. Also if you get the layering wrong and start to sweat, things can go downhill in a hurry.<br />
2) Increasing your intensity such that you’re gulping sub-zero air hurts. While I definitely do this in races, I’m sure it can be detrimental in the long term.</p>
<p>I’d like to be able to do speedwork (running or skiing will do) about one day a week… something like 80/20. I’m a flexible person and the majority of my training/exercise is dictated by logistics, what I feel like doing that day and outdoor temperature. Some winters we can stay in the double digits below zero for long stretches of time. Historically I’d go to the gym for a day or so per week during a cold snap but don’t see myself doing that this year. I’ve done a few virtual running races already this year and see some in my future with skiing. Historically I’ve found it difficult to break out of my “forever pace&#8221;, which is about 15 beats sub MAF. It&#8217;s usually what I default to when out for a run/ski and being able to break out of this pace-rut is (to a lesser degree) an issue when doing these virtual races. Also I’d like to be able to finish stronger in my races. When ski racing with others I’ll generally try to start pulling away 2 miles from the finish, because my sprinting ability (tired or not) tends to be comparatively weaker.</p>
<p>Some ideas I’ve considered to incorporate speedwork in the cold:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use dogs-</strong> Canicross is my favorite option. I’m not sure how much of a thing this is in the lower 48, but it can be really fun. Doing 6 minute miles at MAF behind a few eager huskies is pretty exhilarating. This would be running, not skiing. This seems sort of analogous to treadmill work and I can do it without having to breathe too hard. That said, while it might help the pace-rut issue, I&#8217;m not sure it would actually make me any faster.</li>
<li><strong>Buy a treadmill/erg/ski erg-</strong> I don’t want to do this. I’d have to heat my garage to have a place to store and use it ($$), and I’d rather just be taking it easy (or burning my lungs) outside. You need to get out there enjoy those 3 hours of daylight in winter!</li>
<li><strong>Ditch the subzero speedwork-</strong> Substitute extra weight training/plyometric sessions at home when it&#8217;s cold.</li>
<li><strong>Chillout-</strong> Do speed work when temps allow, keep doing subzero MAF… or sub MAF.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you have other suggestions for what I could be doing? Indoor is okay, I’m just not into spending the money on equipment I don’t think I’ll use once we have a vaccine. That&#8217;s it! I appreciate you taking the time to read to this. If you have questions I&#8217;m hoping they&#8217;re addressed below. Thanks again for doing what you do!</p>
<h3><strong>What the coaches say:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Lucho does not run in weather that is under 30 degrees, but it also depends on the type of workout and if there is wind.</li>
<li>It comes down to whether or not you&#8217;ll be able to achieve the purpose of the workout.</li>
<li>Canicross will use more peripheral and central nervous system work, which is not necessarily what you need.</li>
<li>Substitute with weight training and plyometrics are great options.</li>
<li>Doing speed work when the temperature allows is a good option, depending on when your race is.
<ul>
<li>If the race is 20 weeks out, yes.</li>
<li>If the race is 12-16 weeks out, you&#8217;ll want to get in some faster running.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stay close to home if you&#8217;re going to do any intensity.</li>
<li>Keep your legs overdressed and if you need to cool off, cool off your upper body.</li>
<li>Put a mask on for the cold air.</li>
<li>Fuel appropriately.</li>
<li>Your ability to finish a race stronger is going to depend on your endurance (in the most basic sense). Pace yourself. Lucho recommends strong tempo workouts; for example, 2 x 20 minutes. Or a hill fartlek, pushing it on the uphills, cruising on the downhills (this is considered a form of strength work, and will play into your ability to finish a race fairly strong).</li>
<li>Maximize what you <em>can</em> do, not what you can&#8217;t do!</li>
<li>Acute cold exposure can lead to immunosuppression via an increase in cortisol from the adrenals; however, with regular training that risk factor is attenuated.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Shawn asks:</strong></h2>
<p>Greetings Endurance Planet!!!</p>
<p>Ok, here is my question and I’ll provide information about myself below.  I’ve been enjoying hitting the heavy weights lately, and my running has taken a bit of a back seat. Maybe I’m just burnt out on running? I don’t know. My wife has recently started running and she always wants me to run with her, so I am running three times a week with her. Usually two 3 mile runs and a 4 or 5 mile run on the weekend at about 10:20-30 average pace which is a Heart Rate of about 125 – 130 for me. It’s a very slow and easy effort for me<strong>. My question is, can I still maintain fast running while only doing these 3 slower runs, plus my 3 hours of heavy weight lifting per week ? I’m also starting to do two Zwift sessions for 30 minutes on the bike for intensity. (1 x Jons mix and 1 x Emilys mix). So basically a tempo ride and an interval ride. </strong>I’m enjoying this style of training and it seems to work better for me as far as sleeping and hormones go. Shorter and more intense workouts seem to agree with me more than long distance running or cycling but I still want to remain competitive. I do a 5k trail series every year, a couple sprint triathlons and usually a couple half marathons per year. I ALMOST ALWAYS win my age group and often podium over all in these events.  I want to remain competitive and even get a bit faster at the 5k distance, especially on the trails. However, I also LOVE having a strong body for both practical reason and for vanity. Let’s face it, who doesn’t want a nice body?  The 5k trail series starts in March and I would love to place top 5 for the overall season points. This means I need to run about a  6:50 average pace on the trails. I run 7:20ish – 7:40ish right now pending on the terrain and elevation gain. <strong>Do you think really hard bike sessions plus the easy runs will get the job done? Or do I need to fit in a 4<sup>th</sup> run and do 400’s?  </strong>Up until recently I was running 5 -6 days a week with very little weight lifting and cycling. This was 20-30 miles per week. Right now, I’m just over it, but I know come spring I’ll want to do well in this series.  There is also a sprint triathlon series I’m interested in, and obviously those bikes will help with that. <strong>Am I just wanting too much?</strong> Seems like short course racing and strength is my passion and DNA, but I want to help my wife and run with her too. Thanks for your help!!</p>
<h3><strong>What the coaches say:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>You&#8217;re running enough that the bike will have a crossover.</li>
<li>You have plenty of aerobic fitness, but you could benefit from 5k specific work. Lucho recommends 100-200 meter hill intervals/repeats.</li>
<li>Complimentary work to the weight workouts would be 7-19 second maxed out, hill intervals.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t worry about threshold workouts.</li>
<li>Do a fourth run! Make this run in conjunction with your weight lifting. Do the heavyweights first, then head out shortly after and do the hill sprints.</li>
<li>Listen to your body and these feelings of burnout.</li>

<p>On this episode:</p>
<h2>Intro:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Tawnee and family are in Montana; podcasting live with Julie!</li>
<li>It&#8217;s great to be able to share a run with a friend.</li>

<h2>Cary asks:</h2>
<h3>Health and nutrition coaching</h3>
<p>Hello and thank you SO much for the podcast and insight! I have an in-depth question so thanks in advance for your patience. I am 36 years old and have been running and participating in sports for most of my life. I have run a marathon and a few half marathons, dabbled in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Crossfit and general weight lifting and have always wanted to get into triathlon. Endurance sports make me happy and I really enjoy them.</p>
<p>I have a high stress job, which requires me to sit in a car most of the day and wear gear that is not great for posture and mobility. My work causes decent levels of chronic stress with bouts of acute, adrenaline induced stress sprinkled in there. I injured my back during a crossfit workout years ago, but have “treated” it with rest and static stretching… I know, I know *eye roll* but it is still a chronic issue.</p>
<p>A few months ago, I (irresponsibly) began ramping up my running, started swimming, and regularly mountain biking all at once. While doing this, I cut my calories in an effort to lose some weight but took it too far, and crashed really hard. I lost my libido, almost entirely, was extremely fatigued, and very emotionally “jacked up” for lack of a better term. Additionally, I strained my soleus, rested it, changed my shoes, started running again and now am experiencing pain in my hip. It seems there is always something wrong or something new popping up.</p>
<p>I say all that to say: After listening to your podcast and doing some serious googling, I have realized I have done a lot wrong and need to revamp the way I am living and training to actually get healthy. I am seeing a PT and committed to sorting out whatever is going on mechanically. I am getting bloodwork done to see what&#8217;s going on inside this body of mine. Lastly, I am completely open minded to get myself back to a place where I am healthy enough to train. I have no lifestyle, dietary or fitness convictions that I am unwilling to change OTHER than my job, which I cannot quit or change.</p>
<p>So here is my question:</p>
<p>Presented with a mess of a human, like me, what would your course of action be to evaluate and “fix” a person like me? From developing baseline health markers, fitness markers, treatment plans, stress management, and dietary suggestions. I don’t expect you to give me answers as you would a paying client, more of suggestions on a strategy to get healthy. What tests to have done, what kind of coaches, therapists, doctors to seek out, books to read, articles, websites, podcasts…. There is SOOOOO much information it is overwhelming. Love the work you’re doing and thank you again!</p>
<h3><strong>What the coaches say:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Lasting meaningful change needs to be driven by self-acceptance.&#8221; Language matters &#8211; you&#8217;re not broken.</li>
<li>The foundation here, first and foremost, is mindset; catch yourself when you&#8217;re going down a negative path.</li>
<li>Switch your mindset from &#8220;I <em>have</em> to do this,&#8221; to &#8220;I <em>get</em> to do this!&#8221; Reframing is important; practice, practice, practice.</li>
<li>Use setbacks as a tool to come out stronger.</li>
<li>Reflect on things that were/are going right.
<ul>
<li>Questions that Julie asks her clients, &#8220;When was the last time you felt well? What did that look like?&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Own your strengths!</li>
<li>A sports coach will help you perform better (and may work on the psychology side of things). But there is also space for a nutrition coach that can complement the whole package. A nutrition coach will work with individuals to:
<ul>
<li>Simplify and break things down step by step.</li>
<li>Builds a trusting relationship with the client.</li>
<li>Personalize strategies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Julie outlines examples of small changes:
<ul>
<li>Drink a glass of water before drinking your coffee in the morning.</li>
<li>Higher protein breakfast.</li>
<li>Do 10 pushups at noon every day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You want a coach that will hear, see, and support you.</li>
<li>You&#8217;re already started doing the right steps &#8211; getting bloodwork done, seeing a PT, emailing Endurnace Planet!</li>
<li>Reach out to a supportive coach/therapist that can meet you where you&#8217;re at, and support you along the way.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dan asks:</h2>
<h3>Nutrition and diet</h3>
<p>Hi, Long time listener, first time writer.  I really love the show and community you&#8217;ve built!  Hope you&#8217;re finding some safe places on the van life.</p>
<p>Before my question, some info about me. I&#8217;m 33, male, 6&#8217;1, 160 (I&#8217;m pretty skinny; my tri friends say I have the same build as Jan Frodeno although certainly nowhere near the skill or talent&#8230;), former D1 athlete in college, recently got into Triathlon (I have extensive experience running and biking; starting from pretty much scratch with swimming) after a long time playing competitive ultimate frisbee. I signed up for IM140.6 Coeur d&#8217;Alene in June 2021, my first full-distance IM.  My goal is to finish in 11 hours or under although I&#8217;m not trying to qualify for Kona or get like a sub-9.  I would be thrilled to swim a 1:30.  My half marathon best (self-tested) is 1:24, marathon just over 3:00.  FTP is about 275.</p>
<p>My question is about nutrition and diet.  I&#8217;m 99% vegetarian (my wife is a vegetarian and doesn&#8217;t allow meat in the house) and in general eat really healthy &#8211; salads, stir fries, lots of fruits and veggies in everything from the weekly CSA box, I never eat fast food, supplement work outs with recovery shake, etc. I do like sweets and ice cream at a moderate indulgence.  I drink coffee everyday and craft beer a few times/week.  I&#8217;m not anal about counting calorires to make sure I get enough, I just try to eat when I&#8217;m hungry.  In general I think I&#8217;m performing OK &#8211; my Triathlon coach (who is also a 3-time Kona qualifier), is satisfied with my progress.  I&#8217;m training at this stage about 15 hours/week with no real problems with cramping or anything like that.  I guess my question is how do you know what is the best diet/nutritional intake for me?  I&#8217;ve never really done a test (i.e. eliminating XX for some amount of time) but I&#8217;m not sure if like eating too many carbs (i love good bread and pasta) or dairy, or something else may be having an adverse affect that I&#8217;m not aware of.  How can you discover what you don&#8217;t know?  Is there a good way to test different kinds of diets for Ironman training in case something might work better for me?  I&#8217;ve definitely lost weight since starting training and I don&#8217;t have much more to lose.  I don&#8217;t care about body image or looks, I just want to make sure I&#8217;m giving myself what I need to perform.  I also do all of the cooking in my house so I can adjust things as needed. Really love the show and hope you, John, and the kiddo are doing well!</p>
<h3><strong>What the coaches say:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Restrictive diets should be reserved for people with food sensitivities or allergies.</li>
<li>Julie suggests trying to form the habit of eating meat outside of the house or talking with your wife.
<ul>
<li>Have a designated meat pan so there is no cross-contamination.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Training for an Ironman takes up a lot of time. Tawnee suggests having an open conversation with your wife, meet her where she is at, and see if there is an amicable agreement that can be made. What is her comfort level, what is yours?</li>
<li>Sounds like you&#8217;re relying too much on carbs.</li>
<li>If meat is totally non-negotiable, you can eat out. Examples include:
<ul>
<li>Canned fish (e.g., salmon and sardine &#8211; with the bones).</li>
<li>Buy a premade chicken.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Another possible idea could be to get your own mini-fridge to put the meat.</li>
<li><a href="https://dutchtest.com/shop/">DUTCH Test</a> (for hormonal health), GI Map (for gut health), Organic Acid Test (for nutrient status). Education is a huge part, and working with someone (e.g., functional doctor, nutrition coach) to help you navigate these pieces can be key.</li>
<li>You may have to be a carnivore during an Ironman year, then switch back to being a vegetarian.</li>

<h3><strong>Tawnee&#8217;s <a href="https://ucan.co/share/enduranceplanet/">UCAN</a> Porridge recipe</strong></h3>
<p><b>Ingredients:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>1 serving/pack <a href="https://ucan.co/product/tropical-orange-energy-tub/share/enduranceplanet/">UCAN Tropical Orange</a></li>
<li>1 scoop of your favorite protein powder* (e.g. Tawnee likes <a href="https://mtcapra.com/product/deep-2-30/ref/enduranceplanet/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mt. Capra&#8217;s </span></a>Deep 30 Strawberry Splash** for this recipe)</li>
<li>1/2 cup(ish) shredded coconut</li>
<li>1 tbsp chia seeds</li>
<li>1 cup(ish) non-dairy milk</li>
<li>Liberal shake of Ceylon cinnamon***</li>
<li>Dash of Himalayan salt (to taste)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Directions:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>In a regular-size cereal/soup bowl, mix the dry ingredients first breaking up any clumps from the powders. Add non-dairy milk, mix well, and let chia seeds absorb (at least 5 minutes). Add more milk if the porridge is still too dry or clumpy and/or if you prefer a more “soupy” bowl. Garnish with any fruit, nuts or seeds. No extra sweetener is needed unless desired.</li>
<li>*A vanilla flavored protein powder goes great with the tropical orange UCAN powder.</li>

<h2>Anonymous asks:</h2>
<h3><b>Are you fat-adapted?</b></h3>
<p>I&#8217;m a new listener. How does someone know if they are fat-adapted? I&#8217;m in my mid-40s and started running two years ago. I&#8217;ve done a few half marathons and have maintained a good base by running 20-25 miles a week. Long runs are around 10 miles. I&#8217;ve noticed a few improvements like being able to run faster in Zone 2, but I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m fat adapted. If so, does that mean I need more healthy fats in my diet? Thank you. Keep up the great work, and keeping everyone motivated during this time.</p>
<h3><strong>What the coaches say:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.enduranceplanet.com/d-phil-maffetone-are-you-a-fat-burner/">Start with this show featuring Dr. Phil Maffetone on &#8220;Are You a Fat Burner&#8221;</a></li>
<li>Revisiting some concepts we covered with Dr. Maffetone in that previous episode, including:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li>Overall diet and the quality and quantity.</li>
<li>Metabolic lab testing.</li>
<li>MAF pace improvements and HR control.</li>
<li>Blood glucose monitoring. Generally avoiding big spikes or prolonged elevated blood glucose post-meal, and big crashes or hypoglycemia.</li>
<li>Field “Bonk Test.”Build up to a 2hr aerobic run, or 2-3hr aerobic bike done in a fasted or semi-fasted (fat as fuel) state with no bonk and no post-workout “hangry” effect. (Tawnee is hesitant to tell athletes to go out and do this test.)</li>
<li>Steady energy and how you feel when you wake up in the AM after an overnight fast.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>A balanced diet of protein, fat, and &lt;200 grams of carbohydrates (as long as overall calories are adequate!)
<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t look at just the numbers! The coaches are not fans of constant monitoring of food or diet logging</li>
<li>Heavily relative to what type of training you&#8217;re doing</li>
<li>Tawnee can make the case for a female athlete who needs more like 300-400g carbohydrates a day depending on what type of training she is doing</li>
<li>Lucho uses the example of an athlete being fat-adapted if they do a 5-hour bike ride, and consume 20-30g of carbohydrate an hour</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Eat to train, don&#8217;t train to eat!</li>
<li>You will get better the more you improve your aerobic fitness, economy, and daily diet.</li>
<li>The coaches don&#8217;t think you need to be striving for this state of ultimate fat adaptation. Balance is key.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re working on MAF and not seeing any improvements, that may be a sign that your diet needs some adjustments.</li>

<h2>Multiple people ask:</h2>
<h3><b>On recovery</b></h3>
<p>What can athletes do to mitigate soreness after resistance training?</p>
<h3><strong>What the coaches say:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t think that soreness is necessarily wrong!</li>
<li>DOMS (delayed-onset muscle soreness) is a product of effort, load, and range of motion.</li>
<li>There are a lot of different kinds of strength training (i.e., injury prevention and muscle mass maintenance versus powerlifting).</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re struggling with DOMS you don&#8217;t need to touch weights.</li>
<li>Functional movement needs to be addressed before adding weighted exercises.
<ul>
<li>Fantastic bodyweight exercises: pullups, pushups, burpees, hill intervals, step-ups, Bulgarian split squats, and RDLs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Study: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6895680/">Acute Effects of Static Stretching on Muscle Strength and Power</a>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;The rolling prescription should involve 1–3 sets of 2–4-second repetition duration (time for a single roll in one direction over the length of a body part) with a total rolling duration of 30–120-second per set.”
<ul>
<li>This prescription should be beneficial in achieving an increased range of motion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Preventative steps one could take to mitigate DOMS:
<ul>
<li>Amino acids- <a href="https://bodyhealth.com/pages/search-results?type=product&amp;q=perfect+aminos">Perfect Amino</a>, or your amino of choice, best taken PRE exercise (carb optional). <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11440894/">Studies show</a> that “Delivery of amino acids (amino acid concentration times blood flow) was significantly greater in PRE than in POST during the exercise bout and in the 1st h after exercise.&#8221; Taken with carbs like UCAN may even be a more powerful remedy to feel invincible.</li>
<li>Post-workout protein rich in leucine &#8211; 0.4-0.6 g/kg immediately post-workout
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27284754/">Study</a>: &#8220;The high protein intake (HPI) did not significantly improve recovery compared with MPI (p &gt; .05). However, comparison of within-treatment change shows 1) the HPI provided a moderate beneficial effect (d = 0.66), attenuating the loss of afternoon knee extensor peak isometric torque (PIT) (-3.6%, d = 0.09) compared with the moderate protein intake (MPI) (-8.6%, d = 0.24). And 2) the HPI provided a large beneficial effect (d = 0.83), reducing perceived fatigue over the eight-hour recovery.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Allow enough sleep! Sleep helps with growth hormone release which is essential to recovery.
<ul>
<li>Have this drink first thing in the morning! Tawnee&#8217;s drink includes 30 oz of RO (reverse osmosis) water, drops of <a href="https://amzn.to/3cd3UjM">Trace Minerals</a>, Himalayan salt, and a couple of slices of lemon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/35PQ0mw">Ancient Minerals Magnesium Oil</a> put on after a hard workout or if you feel a niggle coming on.</li>
<li>Compression gear &#8211; plenty of research to show how it can aid in recovery (maybe not as much in performance though).</li>
<li>Tart Cherry Juice. Listen to a <a href="https://www.enduranceplanet.com/ask-the-doc-evaluating-genetic-testing-benefits-of-tart-cherry-food-sensitivity-tests-and-more/">previous episode with Dr. Tommy Wood</a> explaining the benefits.
<ul>
<li>Potential benefits of tart cherry: help muscle soreness and DOMS</li>
<li>Can help with sleep and aids in insomnia relief</li>
<li>A powerful antioxidant</li>
<li>Naturally occurring melatonin</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Contrast water therapy &#8211; a combination of cold and hot, end on cold. Icing may be waste of time while ice baths may feel good for recovery, but could inhibit gains and muscle growth/adaptation.</li>
<li>Avoid excessive booze of 3+ drinks (but 1-2 likely fine)
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20878178/">Study</a>: &#8220;A low dose of alcohol does not impact skeletal muscle performance after exercise-induced muscle damage&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Avoid NSAIDs for pain relief due to stress on kidneys and liver, as well as GI issues with prolonged use (i.e., could be doing more harm than good!). And may even hinder adaptation and growth! Try curcumin instead, check out Thrive Meriva on <a href="https://us.fullscript.com/welcome/eplanet">Fullscript</a>. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31340534/">At least 200mg of curcumin may help with soreness,</a><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>and in this case, might be <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30814417/">best to take it after exercise.</a></li>

<li>Pt 4 &#8211; Spring 2021 (To come)</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Blackberries</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The best flavor quality is at full maturity (you can tell the berry is at its full maturity when the color changes to a dull black).</li>
<li>They lose flavor and nutritional value every day after being picked, but most berries are frozen on the same day of harvest which retains a lot of their nutritional value.</li>
<li>One of the highest levels of antioxidants.</li>
<li>One cup is 50% of Vitamin C and 30% of fiber.</li>
<li>Phytochemicals are compounds that are known to help fight chronic disease.</li>
<li>The rich color of blackberries comes from a phytochemical called anthocyanins
<ul>
<li>Anthocyanins act like antioxidants that may help the brain from oxidative stress and reduce the effects of conditions like dementia.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Interesting Fact: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4632771/#B131-ijms-16-24673">they are being studied for their ability to inhibit tumor growth</a></li>
<li>Study: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4632771/#B131-ijms-16-24673">Bioactive Compounds and Antioxidant Activity in Different Types of Berries</a></li>
<li>Storage tip from the <a href="https://www.seasonalfoodguide.org/">Seasonal Food Guide</a>: if you&#8217;re unable to eat the berries with 48 hours, freeze them on a tray and then transfer to a plastic freezer bag to minimize clumpage.</li>
<li>Gently wash with a spray bottle when you’re ready to use them. Keep them refrigerated, highly susceptible to mold and spoilage. Store in the fridge with a paper towel over them to reduce moisture.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Parsnips</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Parsnips are low FODMAP but can be higher glycemic index however they have a low glycemic load (with any blood glucose concerns just test your individual response).</li>
<li>Can be a great alternative to those sensitive to certain carbs or needing to avoid grains, but not wanting to go low carb; and they are lower in sugar than carrots.</li>
<li>Parsnips are incredibly high in insoluble fiber, which prevents the release of ghrelin and keeps you fuller longer.</li>
<li>For every 1 cup of parsnips, there’s roughly 24 grams of carbs and about 6-7 grams of fiber!</li>
<li>Parsnips are also high in folate (great for pregnant people), Vitamins C &amp; E (antioxidant superheroes), and potassium.</li>
<li>Their stalks and leaves contain a sap that can be irritating and hazardous to the skin and is best avoided.</li>
<li><strong>Paleo Parsnip-Orange Saute Recipe By Tawnee</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ingredients:
<ul>
<li>5 parsnips, washed &amp; peeled</li>
<li>2 carrots, washed &amp; peeled</li>
<li>1 sweet onion</li>
<li>1 navel orange*</li>
<li>½ head small green cabbage (about 2 cups)</li>
<li>½ cup fresh parsley</li>
<li>3 tbsp coconut oil</li>
<li>Salt, to taste</li>
<li>Optional: Coconut Aminos, to taste</li>
<li>*For more orange essence, use 2 oranges.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Directions:<br />
Wash all veggies. Peel the parsnips and carrots. Then chop parsnips and carrots into about half-inch cubes (halve twice then chop). Chop the rest of the veggies next. Cut onions into 1-inch slices, and cabbage to 1-inch squares. Coarse chop parsley, and cut orange up into slices, leaving skin on. Heat a large pan or Dutch oven on the stovetop to medium-high heat, and melt a couple of tablespoons of coconut oil. Add the parsnips and carrots first and lets them cook for about 5 minutes, then add onion. After about 10 minutes add the cabbage and more coconut oil. Maintain a medium heat and don’t let the veggies burn or get too browned (stir often and, if needed, add more oil to prevent burning).After 20 minutes squeeze in the juice of ¾ of the orange (or juice of 1 ½ oranges if stronger flavor is desired) and add the parsley. Cut the remaining orange into small chunks, remove skin, and set aside. At 30 minutes turn off the heat, add the remaining orange chunks and stir in. Let the sauté set for another 5-10 minutes before serving.</li>
<li>Optional: Serve with Coconut Aminos to drizzle onto the parsnip sauté.</li>
<li>This goes great with pastured poultry or grass-fed beef. I served it with herbed turkey meatballs and it was a good match.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/01/science/science-watch-poison-and-the-parsnip.html">Ok, but is there a caveat to parsnips?</a>
<ul>
<li>“Parsnip, a root vegetable, has been indicted. Only this time, a common food has been shown to contain substantial amounts of potentially harmful substances. They are called psoralens and can damage genes, cause skin reactions in sunlight and become potential cancer-causing agents after exposure to sunlight, according to scientists from a United States Department of Agriculture laboratory in College Station, Tex.</li>
<li>“When the parsnip was peeled, psoralens in the vegetable were reduced by 30 percent, but were still present in worrisome concentrations, the scientists reported in the Aug. 21 issue of Science. Cooking the parsnip did not change the concentration of psoralens. ‘It is apparent that consumption of moderate quantities of this vegetable by man can result in the intake of appreciable amounts of psoralens’ the researchers concluded. ‘Parsnips and other psoralen-containing food plants may present some toxicological risk to man.’”</li>
<li>Tawnee&#8217;s take on this: don&#8217;t worry about it too much; moderation is key.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Brussels Sprouts</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Their name comes from Belgium.</li>
<li>The majority are grown on the central coast of California where the cooler airs create the perfect conditions.</li>
<li>All parts of the plant are edible, but if you have any gut issues, you may want to cook them for better digestion.
<ul>
<li>Peel away the skins to make crispy baked brussels sprouts chip</li>
<li>Can roast or steam them</li>
<li>Slice them thin for a salad</li>
<li>Cut top to bottom and roast or steam or stir-fry or grill them</li>
<li>Julie&#8217;s favorite recipe is <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1890-roasted-brussels-sprouts-with-garlic">Roasted Brussel Sprouts with Garlic</a> (bonus points when I have bacon to toss in).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Even though one of the more hated vegetables, chefs have begun to make them popular; the varieties are less bitter and sweeter than they used to be (same goes for kale and artichokes).</li>
<li>What to look for? On and off the stalk. Compact heads with no sign of dulling or wilting and the sprouts should be bright green.</li>
<li>Storage tips: keep in the fridge for 2 weeks if on the stalk, and 1 week if not.</li>
<li>Affordable food with high nutrition &#8211; vitamin C,K, folate, manganese, copper, choline, vitamins B1, B6, and potassium.</li>
<li>Have a brussels sprouts cookoff!</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Mushrooms</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>They are fungi, not a plant.</li>
<li>Can be found year-round but abundant in the fall.</li>
<li>If you get into wild foraging do your research and do so with caution as many mushrooms are not edible.</li>
<li>We encourage you to try different varieties! Tawnee was getting a mushroom chef’s sampler from her local CSA when she still lived in a house.</li>
<li>Tawnee prefers the taste for cremini and portobello over the white button. Shiitake and chanterelles are also great.</li>
<li>Buy firm and dry mushrooms, not those that are slimy, wrinkling, or have any moisture damage.</li>
<li>Best to store in a paper bag with paper towels (not in plastic containers like the ones sold in stores).</li>
<li>Salt later in cooking to avoid them getting too tough.</li>
<li>Mushrooms may have prebiotic properties:
<ul>
<li>One type of mushroom extract may act as a prebiotic to benefit the gut in helping to overcome obesity</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrgastro.2015.137">Modulation of the gut microbiota is one of the promising tools to tackle obesity. Chang and colleagues have recently shown that an extract of the mushroom <em>Ganoderma lucidum</em>, a traditional remedy in Asia, can reduce obesity in mice by modulating the gut microbiota, thereby exerting a prebiotic effect.</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can have a beneficial effect on immune function and even help against respiratory infections.</li>
<li>You also see companies like <a href="https://us.foursigmatic.com/">Four Sigmatic</a> making the adaptogenic properties of some mushrooms (like reishi mushrooms) more widely available. These mushrooms help fight stress and have many other health benefits.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Ginger</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Hawaii is the top US producer. But can be grown in colder climates. Top global producers are China, Nepal, India, and Nigeria</li>
<li>Will lose its potency over time; store in a resealable plastic bag with all the air pushed out in your crisper</li>
<li>Preparation tip &#8211; try pealing with a teaspoon! It&#8217;s supposed to be easier to get in the nooks without losing any flesh.</li>
<li>Ginger tea is Julie&#8217;s favorite! Slice unpeeled ginger into coins, bring water to a boil, and let the ginger steep for 10-20 minutes (add honey or lemon if you want).</li>
<li>Julie brings <a href="https://gingerpeople.com/products/gin-gins-original-chewy-ginger-candy/">Gin Gins</a> on adventures in case her stomach gets upset. She also recommends adding ginger to cookies, homemade bars, or granola to help prevent/manage stomach upset during endurance days.</li>
<li>One of the ten most commonly used natural alternative medical treatments in the United States and is suggested as a possible alternative to pharmaceuticals for reducing pain and/or inflammation.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4408745/">Evidence</a> supports the use of ginger to aid recovery from muscle-damaging exercise and for longer durations of intake (&gt;2 days), as a single-acute dose had no effect on pain perception following low-moderate cycling [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4408745/#B187">187</a>].
<ul>
<li>Summary: ginger can be beneficial for alleviating intense muscle exercise induced pain</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can help with dizziness and nausea. <a href="https://www.active.com/nutrition/articles/4-reasons-why-athletes-should-eat-ginger">This article </a>suggests trying to take 1g of ginger before the swim to see if it helps with post-swim dizziness.

<ul>
<li>Purpose of the study: to discuss the effects of iron deficiency (ID) and anemia in combination with low energy availability (LEA) and the implications for female athletes bone health</li>
<li>LEA &#8211; the inability to consume a sufficient amount of calories to support health and energy expenditure, which is associated with a dietary intake below 30ca/kg of fat-free mass (FFM) compared to the optimal 45cal/kg of FFM (For Julie, that is the difference of 1,000 calories).</li>
<li>Athletes can easily expend over 3,000 calories/day</li>
<li>ID makes LEA worse because of alterations to an athlete&#8217;s metabolic efficiency, which can increase energy expenditure.</li>
<li>Eumenorhic athletes had higher blood glucose, T3, estrogen, and reaction time compared to amenorrheic</li>
<li>Hormones and the timing of nutrients:
<ul>
<li>Hepcidin is a hormone that is produced and released from the liver and degrades ferroportin, the channel responsible for iron efflux from the cell; this action traps iron within the cell, which makes it unavailable for use in muscle for oxidative phosphorylation and bone marrow for hemoglobin production.</li>
<li>Hepcidin is elevated after exercise and can result in decreased iron absorption with a slowing of iron efflux from the liver and spleen (i.e., after exercise, hepcidin is elevated for up to 6 hours which makes it hard to absorb iron).</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re struggling with low iron levels you may want to find a different time to supplement with iron.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Recommendations:
<ul>
<li>Take your iron supplement with vitamin C for the best absorption.</li>
<li>But avoid taking your iron supplement with calcium and caffeine.
<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t take your iron with coffee! An hour before coffee seems to work well for Julie.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Need to eat more than you think to meet your energy requirements</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Iron is a necessary component of thyroid hormone synthesis; t3 and t4 which both influence bone growth.</li>
<li>Bones! Peak bone density ages 25-35</li>
<li>LEA equals not enough food, equals not enough nutrients, equals not enough iron, and oxygen for bone health.
<ul>
<li>Increased chance for injury, hormonal disturbance, and poor bone development early on</li>
<li>Need to eat more than you think to meet your energy, macro and micro, requirements</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>“LEA can result in a decrease to the RMR, t3, GH, and IGF1 which can result in menstrual disruption and poor bone health. It is apparent from the available literature that ID can potentiate the adverse effects that endocrine and menstrual disruption can have on bone health.”</li>
<li>Bone remodeling is sensitive to energy availability and hormonal signaling through HPA.</li>
<li>Estrogen both stops bone tissue breakdown and stimulates new bone tissue.</li>
<li>Thyroid tie in:
<ul>
<li>Iron necessary for thyroid hormone synthesis</li>
<li>ID can impede optimal thyroid function</li>
<li>Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can negatively affect bone remodeling.</li>
<li>The development of ID may exacerbate a state of LEA and low T3 in high-performing female athletes.</li>
<li>Both ID and depressed T3 are problematic because T3 and T4 influence bone growth and development during childhood as well as maintenance in adulthood.</li>
<li>Take home: Start monitoring  young female athletes early on don’t wait till too late</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Female Vegan Athletes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Summary: “macro and micronutrient needs can certainly be met on a meat-free diet, but understanding how to execute a nutritionally sound vegan diet is key.&#8221; And: A vegan diet without supplementation will generally not supply all needed nutrients.&#8221;</li>
<li>A vegan diet may be part of a pattern of disordered eating</li>
<li>No high-quality studies examining long-term effects of the <strong>vegan </strong>diet as it pertains to athletic performance; most research is mixed in with vegetarianism.</li>
<li>A well-planned vegan diet seems to be as adequate for performance as an omnivorous diet, but a vegan diet without supplementation will generally not supply all needed nutrients</li>
<li>Iron: vegans need 1.8x higher than omnivores or 32mg/d</li>
<li>Essential amino acids are lower in some foods: leucine, lysine, and methionine.
<ul>
<li>Food recommendations:
<ul>
<li>Leucine -corn, spirulina, black beans, rice, soy, lentil, pea, oat, and quinoa.</li>
<li>Lysine &#8211; lentil, black bean, mycoprotein, quinoa, pea, and soy.</li>
<li>Methionine &#8211; quinoa, hemp, rice, corn, spirulina, wheat, and oat.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Intake of leucine in a vegan diet should be approximately double that of a diet including animal proteins,</strong> and particularly for individuals who partake in total body strength exercises, older athletes, and those with muscle-wasting conditions.</li>
<li>Current evidence suggests that an anabolic response from plant proteins may be lower than that of animal proteins, but very few studies currently exist on the subject, and none examine specifically the effect of plant proteins on the muscle growth of female athletes. Some data on soy and wheat-based proteins demonstrate that they are more easily converted to urea than milk-based proteins, which may account for the potential of these plant proteins to be less anabolic. It is not understood exactly why this happens, but one hypothesis is that in sub-optimal EAA conditions, the body sends free amino acids to the liver, leaving them unavailable for muscle synthesis.</li>
<li>Vitamin D: According to Shuler et al., musculoskeletal benefits such as fracture prevention start at circulating vitamin D levels of about 40 ng/mL, with athletic benefits capping at 50 ng/mL.
<ul>
<li>Sun or lichen sources may be good options here</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Overall:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Great attention is needed especially in the beginning of embarking on a Vegan diet.</li>
<li>May need to eat more pasta and bread to meet energy needs as an endurance athlete</li>
<li>You need nearly double the iron and leucine</li>
<li>Eat a variety and combination of plant protein sources and be aware of your calorie intake to ensure you’re meeting your energy needs</li>
<li>Manage training load</li>
</ul>

<li>Our heart goes out to all the communities impacted by the forest fires in California.</li>
<li>A quick follow-up to <a href="https://www.enduranceplanet.com/atc-317/">ATC&#8217;s 317: The 3-Minute Burpee Test</a> (discussed after the rapid fire questions)</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Rapid Fire Questions for Lucho:</b></h2>
<ul>
<li>What are your top book recommendations and/or best books you&#8217;ve recently read? (Does not have to be about sport)
<ul>
<li>Lucho has been an avid reader his whole life. He read the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089D28VN2/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=endurplane01-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B089D28VN2&amp;linkId=adbe71675befe50a4500305177b2e7f1">Tarzan series by Edgar Rice Burroughs</a> and a lot of Steven King novels when he was a young kid. Now he mostly reads to relax at the end of the day (i.e., Lee Child, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1524705934/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=endurplane01-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1524705934&amp;linkId=897e2ec941d2d37fecf2bf624b77cd6c">Craig Johnson &#8211; the Longmire mysteries</a>, and C.J. Box). He&#8217;s also read the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439195269/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=endurplane01-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1439195269&amp;linkId=9d17aa3734aa362b8cb587ec30995615">Lonesome Dove</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1787557901/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=endurplane01-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1787557901&amp;linkId=9b34bdd1a310128eea558c3d627b708e">Moby Dick</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307387895/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=endurplane01-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0307387895&amp;linkId=372add6429cd428df6aff8a78050b72a">The Road</a> (Lucho doesn&#8217;t recommend you read this book if you&#8217;re a new father), and the Quran.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re interested in these books, help support the podcast by clicking on the link(s) above.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What time do you go to bed? (And do you still have insomnia, if not what has helped?)
<ul>
<li>Lucho goes to bed around 8-8:30 pm. His routine might be considered abnormal to most, but he enjoys it. He does recognize that his hard workouts might affect his ability to sleep, but it doesn&#8217;t seem to negatively affect him.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Mike asks:</b></h2>
<h3><b>Intensity work and sex drive: Is there a correlation?</b></h3>
<div>Good day. Thank you again for the podcast and the willingness to answer our questions.  I did my high intensity work today and even though it didn’t go as well as planned I felt pretty good about myself and my sex drive was elevated.  I had noticed this in the past: higher intensity work equates to feeling better and higher drive.  I tend to have the opposite feeling with long runs as they tend to drain and take away from me.  Is this a normal feeling?  Does it have to do with hormones? Is it neurotyping?</div>
<h3><strong>What the coaches say:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Testosterone isn&#8217;t a part of the neurotyping
<ul>
<li>Although, Neurotype 1&#8217;s may have higher testosterone because they naturally lean towards powerlifting, weight lifting, sprinting, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Check out <a href="http://Lifepostcollective.com">Lifepostcollective.com</a> where you can sign up for free to access Tawnee&#8217;s articles, no strings attached and see this article we mention, focusing on natural ways and workouts to boost T: <a href="https://lifepostcollective.com/workouts-and-guidelines-to-increase-testosterone-naturally/">https://lifepostcollective.com/workouts-and-guidelines-to-increase-testosterone-naturally/ </a><b></b></li>
<li><a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/drugs-and-medications/testosterone--what-it-does-and-doesnt-do"><b>Harvard Health on Testosterone</b></a>
<ul>
<li>More than a third of men over age 45 may have reduced levels of testosterone than might be considered normal (though, as mentioned, defining optimal levels of testosterone is tricky and somewhat controversial)</li>
<li>Symptoms of testosterone deficiency in adult men include:
<ul>
<li>Reduced body and facial hair</li>
<li>Loss of muscle mass</li>
<li>Low libido, impotence, small testicles, reduced sperm count and infertility</li>
<li>Increased breast size</li>
<li>Hot flashes</li>
<li>Irritability, poor concentration, and depression</li>
<li>Loss of body hair</li>
<li>Brittle bones and an increased risk of fracture</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>High-intensity exercise will have an acute (and potentially long-term) benefit to testosterone levels and sex drive</li>
<li>Strength training, power, speed, and HIIT exercises release more growth hormones and anabolic hormones (I.e., testosterone)
<ul>
<li>Too much cardio/endurance training may deplete these hormones (but the “how much” obviously depends)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Endurance training releases higher amounts of cortisol and catabolic hormones</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Multiple studies have shown that you can boost your testosterone levels by sprinting or HIIT
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21849912/">Physiological and performance changes from the addition of a sprint interval program to wrestling training</a>
<ul>
<li>The SIT consisted of 6 x 35-m sprints at maximum effort with a 10-second recovery between each sprint</li>
<li>The SIT protocol was performed in 2 sessions per week, for the 4 weeks of the study</li>
<li>Testosterone levels remained high even after those people had fully recovered from the sprint workout</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23310924">Testosterone responses to intensive interval versus steady-state endurance exercise</a>
<ul>
<li>Steady-state endurance (SSE) session consisted of a continuous 45-min run at 60-65% VO2max</li>
<li>HIIT session was repeated periods of 90-sec treadmill running at 100-110% maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) and 90-sec active recovery at 40% VO2max for 42-47 min.</li>
<li>The sprints boosted testosterone significantly more than the relatively easy jog. Both increased free T, it’s just that the sprints did a better job</li>
<li>HIIT might produce a more pronounced turnover of FT by androgen-sensitive tissue than the SSE form of exercise</li>
</ul>
</li>

</li>
<li><a href="https://www.enduranceplanet.com/ryan-hall/">Ryan Hall: On Rebuilding Health, How to be a Wiser and More Intuitive Athlete, His Top 4 Strength Exercises for Runners, and Much More</a></li>
<li>What’s the main difference between HIIT vs chronic cardio (hard to find a definitive answer)</li>
<li><a href="http://europepmc.org/article/med/3343919">Reproductive hormonal profiles of endurance-trained and untrained males. </a>
<ul>
<li>The findings indicate that chronic endurance training lowers testosterone and free testosterone in males possibly by impairing testicular function.</li>
<li>The endurance-trained men in the study were training about 6.6 days a week on average, 68 minutes per session on average with a ~34min 10k PR and 167min marathon PR, and had been training this way for at least the past 12 months</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Resistance training too, of course
<ul>
<li>For the biggest testosterone benefit: Weight training @ 80-95% 1RM with longer rest, also focus on lower body</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t skip leg day!</li>

<h2><b>Bob asks:</b></h2>
<div>
<h3><b>I did everything wrong, but what was the worst thing?</b></h3>
<p>I live in the desert at 4,300 feet and regularly run trails up to 10,000 feet — and occasionally up to 14,000. I’ve run the Grand Canyon Rim to Rim twice. So I’m no stranger to the conditions that led to the following incident.</p>
<p>I drove to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon to run the Rim Trail out and back to see the sunset — 6.8 miles each way. The temperature was below 80 degrees, which seemed perfect. Maybe that’s why I didn’t prepare or even do the run intelligently. The night before, I had a couple of beers. The day of, I had a pint of ice cream and some potato chips for lunch. Then there was a 30-minute nap.</p>
<p>I began at 5pm. I ran to Hermit’s Rest without drinking any water or eating anything. At Hermit’s Rest, I drank a liter of water and ate an F-Bomb, then started back. That’s when the shit hit the fan. About a mile in, my calves started feeling fatigued. I switched to walking/running/walking/<wbr />running. The calves got worse. The muscles felt so depleted that I walked more and more slowly. When I would stop to stretch them, they would cramp. By then it was dark, and I worried that I might be sleeping outside that night. The pain in my calves and up into the backs of my knees was intense — never felt that before.</p>
<p>Now, the post-mortem: I admit that my pre-run diet was shitty. But the run was less than 14 miles at a fairly constant 7,000-foot elevation — no big deal. One thing I’m wondering about is this: I almost always wear compression tights when I run, in part so I don’t have to smear sunblock on my legs. This time, however, I wore non-compression shorts and plastered SPF 100 on my lower legs and the backs of my knees.</p>
<p>Could there be something in the sunblock that was absorbed through my skin?<br />
Was it just lack of water and electrolytes?<br />
Was it a combination of stupid decisions?</p>
<p>Love the show — even if you say I’m an idiot!</p>
</div>
<h3><strong>What the coaches say:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://sock-doc.com/?s=sunscreen">link</a> to a few articles on sunscreen written by The Sock Doc</li>
<li>What? Homemade sunscreen! Here&#8217;s a recipe:
<ul>
<li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
<li>1 cup coconut oil</li>
<li>1/4 cup beeswax</li>
<li>4 TBS shea butter</li>
<li>6 TBS non-nano zinc oxide</li>
<li>Few drops of lavender essential oil (optional)Recipe source: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mommyinmaine/">MommyInMaine</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The blood sugar crash from the ice cream and potato chips could have lead to the nap
<ul>
<li>Athletes want to be careful not to have a spike in blood sugar 30-60 minutes before a race because it could lead to a huge drop in blood sugar</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A previous episode with <a href="https://www.enduranceplanet.com/kona-special-how-to-race-well-in-the-heat-a-few-tricks-to-stay-cool-and-a-giveaway-with-paul-laursen-phd/">Paul Laursen</a>; no more than 800 ml of water per hour.</li>
<li>Compression is better for a recovery aspect than a performance aspect
<ul>
<li>Compression leggings are good for proprioception (it helps with running economy)</li>

Lawrence is a movement specialist and specializes in structural integration; he has helped thousands of runners to overcome injuries, transcend athletic achievement and be healthier—from amateur athletes to seasoned professionals at the top level of endurance sport.

<p>If you have any follow-up questions for Lawrence, please email us at questions@enduranceplanet.com.</p>
<p><strong>On this episode:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Previous episode mentioned: <a href="https://www.enduranceplanet.com/dr-phil-maffetone-alan-couzens-pros-and-cons-of-metabolic-testing-plus-maf-qa/">Dr. Phil Maffetone and &amp; Alan Couzens: Pros and Cons of Metabolic Testing, Plus: MAF Q&amp;A</a></li>
<li>Lawrence&#8217;s background includes training as a chiropractor, completing a postgraduate degree in sports chiropractic. He used to work with elite athletes on movement, treatment, and mobilization. Now he primarily works on fascia and movement.</li>
<li>Difference between a sub 2:10 vs. a 4:00+ marathon runner
<ul>
<li>Has a lot to do with the shape and the position they can hold</li>
<li>You want to see:
<ul>
<li>Ankles and feet that are more relaxed</li>
<li>Shoulders soften</li>
<li>More length in torso</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What you can&#8217;t do in a training workshop you can&#8217;t do when you run</li>
<li>Best way to train without causing tension:
<ul>
<li>Calm and relax your nervous system down to create space and fluidity in your body
<ul>
<li>If you relax, the tissues fall into place more naturally</li>
<li>Keep movement in your natural range of motion</li>
<li>Learn how to position and manipulate your body so that you know how it intrinsically feels to be in that position</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Breathe</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Control your nervous system through breathing
<ul>
<li>Breathe less, slower, and softer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A lot of the movements that Lawrence does in his workshops are based on somatic movements
<ul>
<li>Slow down</li>
<li>Learn intrinsic movement patterns</li>
<li>Sync up breathing and movement (this especially helps with back pain)
<ul>
<li>Example: during the Cat-Cow exercise breathe in as you arch your back, and breathe out as you round your back.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It&#8217;s important to actively work on your breathing
<ul>
<li>Work on slow, soft breathing for ~15 minutes a day</li>
<li>The 365 Method
<ul>
<li>3 times a day, breathe 6 breaths a minute for 5 minutes total. Repeat 365 days a year</li>
<li>Nose breathe while doing this method (helps you breathe into your diaphragm)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>The importance of maintaining a balance between the parasympathetic system (rest and digest) and sympathetic nervous system</li>
<li>Without the parasympathetic system, your digestion and sleep are affected which impacts the recovery process
<ul>
<li>This can all lead to a cycle of poor sleep, anxiety, and tension which contributes to a sympathetic overload</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The roles of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the body:
<ul>
<li>Oxygen is a vasoconstrictor (blood vessel constrictor) and a smooth muscle constructor (airway constrictor)
<ul>
<li>When you&#8217;re hyperventilating you need more oxygen but you’re also hyper oxygenated</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Carbon Dioxide is a vasodilator (opens up the blood vessels) and a bronchodilator (softens your tissue) and increases your ability to breathe. It also facilities oxygen transport from your red blood cells into your tissues (like a lubricant for oxygen).
<ul>
<li>It’s very beneficial to have normal levels of CO2 in your bloodstream.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lawrence uses an <a href="https://ouraring.com/?g_acctid=553-919-5922&amp;g_campaign=Brand%20-%20US&amp;g_campaignid=1016078591&amp;g_adgroupid=70823106696&amp;g_adid=358152786858&amp;g_keyword=oura%20ring&amp;g_keywordid=aud-580194463912:kwd-305035554360&amp;g_network=g&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwvvj5BRDkARIsAGD9vlLE4AyEAcvGQMkXr9NEeIbVYTiiQ7zGarchQ1oyNsZ_BjPgqBZsQZ0aArsqEALw_wcB">Oura ring</a> to observe HRV and respiration rate</li>
<li>The most important thing is to have a daily routine!</li>
<li>Sync breathes into movement
<ul>
<li>Lawrence encourages foam rolling to 6 breaths per minute</li>
<li>Spend time softening and slowing down your breathing</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How does Lawrence approach his work</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>He treats everyone as if they are a runner because if you can run then you can move in a functional manner</li>
<li>He treats individuals problems/concerns and gets them to a point where they can run if they wanted to</li>
<li>Running 30 minutes, 4x a week is a good, loose goal</li>
<li>&#8220;Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution&#8221; &#8211; Dobzhansky</li>
<li>He treats everyone from a functional anthropological and anatomical viewpoint</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/030774180X?ie=UTF8">The Story of the Human Body by Daniel E. Lieberman</a> (if you&#8217;d like to support the show use this link!)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Barefoot and minimal running</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We have more nerve endings in our feet than in our hands</li>
<li>Find a safe place to run barefoot</li>
<li>Slowly build the level of strength in the feet</li>
<li>A goal to aim for:
<ul>
<li>Run an easy jog for 20 minutes 2x a week</li>
<li>Start with a 1-minute easy jog, then every 4 runs add another minute</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Barefoot running downregulates the nervous system</li>
<li>Currently, Lawrence runs in Asics GlideRides and wears Luna sandals</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lawrence&#8217;s <a href="https://www.innerunner.com/contact">InnerRunner Workshops</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sync up your breathing</li>
<li>How to use your hips in a synchronized manner</li>
<li>Forward shift vs. forward lean
<ul>
<li>Try and just get your <em>hips</em> to shift forward</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Plus so much more</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Resistance training </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The forces of running are large so you can only replicate it with heavyweights or plyometrics</li>
<li>There is room for a little bit of strength training
<ul>
<li>Lawrence likes squats and deadlifts</li>
<li>&#8220;When it comes to being strong, you need to be stable.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The goal is to become more resilient
<ul>
<li>You&#8217;re working on movement, balance, coordination, and timing</li>
<li>You want to move with length and strength</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ask yourself: what is your intent behind what you do?</li>
<li>Lawrence likes to do <a href="https://youtu.be/LAYAd69KK5I">The Turkish Getup</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lawrence&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0jzRxCAyA7tTH-85PmFMqw">YouTube Channel</a> highlights</strong></p>
<p>Before a run, Lawrence recommends:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/9s1SszFvySE">Rounding and Arching and Synchronized Breathing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/Jmm4RExzqeY">Pelvic Clocks </a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.innerunner.com/blog/thoughts-on-fluidity-tension-rhythm-and-effort">Adding fluidity and timing</a></p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to add fluidity and timing to your running, practice it at rest, or lying down if you can calm your body and make it flow at home when you are calm you may find it appearing in your movement.</li>
<li>Rhythm allows you to relax. Staccato is not rhythm. 180 steps per minute to a metronome is not rhythm, which ends up staccato. That creates tension. If you believe “tight is right” then by all means us staccato.</li>
<li>To be fluid and run with rhythm, to free up movement and delay fatigue you have to be of a calm mind, breathe freely and be in the moment.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/74a17Ou_jb0?list=PL7Krv_i8yE3DpvbHiKUCqtl80EEC4Y4Qn">Happy penguin</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Foundational: learn how to stack body (i.e., vertebrae, hip, legs)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZZgEOQpC9I">Connect your Core and Switch on Glutes: Frog Bridge to Butterfly Crunchie</a></p>
<ul>
<li>How to link your anterior core to your hips and glutes for a more connected core, hips, and glutes. Great for people that have lost weight, after pregnancy or people that feel they have weak glutes and or stomach muscles. Great for achieving a six-pack.</li>
<li>People with overactive hip flexors, iliopsoas muscles, or deep anterior core tension will find it useful. It is also a great Thoracic spine mobilizing exercise.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t88kgtn784">Big Toe walk for better gait/ how to walk</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Walking fast is counterproductive; don’t use it to burn calories</li>
<li>Recommended is at least 1 hour to 90 minutes four times per week.</li>

<h3 dir="auto"><strong>What the Coaches say:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>This study aimed to develop international standards for evaluating strength endurance with the use of the 3‐Minute Burpee Test</li>
<li>Random population sample of over 3,000 women and almost 6,000 men</li>
<li>Average age of participants was 20 years old</li>
<li>On average the men completed 56.69 cycles/3-minute test, and the women completed 48.84/3-minute test</li>
<li>The best male participant completed 82 burpees, and the best female participant completed 73 burpees</li>
<li>Both Lucho and Tawnee decided to complete the 3-Minute Burpee Test!
<ul>
<li>Lucho completed:
<ul>
<li>60 without pushups</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tawnee completed:
<ul>
<li>30 with pushups</li>
<li>47 without pushups</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lucho has been doing burpees during his stream workout sessions
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mtntactical.com/knowledge/the-burpee-beep-ladder-assessment/?highlight=burpees">Burpee Beep Ladder Assessment</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The only thing that Lucho has seen that qualifies as a true burpee is when the thighs and chest touch the floor (how you get down doesn&#8217;t necessarily matter).</li>
<li>We encourage you to do a 3-Minute Burpee Test! Email us at questions@enduranceplanet.com and let us know how it went! We&#8217;d love to hear from you.</li>

</div>
<h3 dir="auto"><strong>What the Coaches say:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>This study aimed to find the correlation between all cause mortality, specific mortality, and physical activity</li>
<li>All cause mortality and specific mortality categorized into 8 different causes: cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory tract disease, accidents and injuries, Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, diabetes mellitus, influenza and pneumonia, and nephritis.</li>
<li>Longitudinal study (8.75 years)</li>
<li>479,856 US adults followed from 1997-2014</li>
<li>Participants 18 years of age or older</li>
<li>Physical activity categories:
<ul>
<li><strong>Insufficient Activity</strong> defined as those who were not meeting the standards of the 2018 physical activity guidelines</li>
<li><strong>Aerobic Only</strong> defined as &#8220;at least 150 minutes a week of moderate intensity aerobic activity (e.g., gardening, brisk walking), or 75 minutes a week of vigorous intensity aerobic activity (e.g., running, faster cycling).&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Strength Only</strong> defined as &#8220;muscle strengthening activity was sufficient at a recommended ≥2 times/week and insufficient if &lt;2 times/week.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Aerobic and Strength</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>59,819 participants died
<ul>
<li>Most deaths from cancer and cardiovascular disease (8 causes total were identified &#8211; see above)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Those who did both Aerobic and Strength had a 40% reduction in all cause mortality</li>
<li>Aerobic only 29% reduced risk (also reduced risk in all 8 causes identified in the study)</li>
<li>Strength only 11% reduced risk (reduced from only 3 causes)</li>
<li>&#8220;<b>Physical inactivity is estimated </b><b>to be responsible for 6-10% of the global burden </b><b>of major chronic non-communicable diseases and </b><b>9% of premature deaths.&#8221;</b></li>
<li>Physical inactivity equates to a &#8220;total cost of $53.8 billion to healthcare systems worldwide in 2013. Among all countries, the United States has the highest economic burden, of about $24.7 billion in healthcare costs (accounting for 45.9% of global healthcare costs).&#8221;</li>
<li>From the burpee study: &#8220;Weekly aerobic training should involve 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise (46 to 63% of maximal oxygen uptake, VO2max) for 30 to 60 minutes per session and/or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity exercise (64 to 90% of VO2max) for 20 to 60 minutes per session.&#8221; (Klika and Jordan, 2013)

<h2><span style="color: #000000; font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><b>Matt from Australia asks:</b></span></h2>
<h3><span style="color: #000000; font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><b>Want my cake and eat it too!</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">First off love the show especially ATC! I have systematically gone through and listened to pretty much all the episodes. My question is I want to increase my speed (who doesn’t?) while training for distance races, I have a 45km trail run lined up for early October and then a 30km in mid-November. I normally stick to 5k,10k and half marathons but with the current situation my normal races are not on. I feel the easy answer to improving my 1k (3.24) and 5k (19.31)  PBs is to improve my out and out speed. Currently I am topping out at 15s for 100m. In my youth it was a flat 12s and I am now 38. With all of life&#8217;s factors I usually run between 40-70km a week. I am sure Lucho could rant on this for a while, I would love to hear.</span></p>
<h3 dir="auto"><strong>What the Coaches say:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The first thing you need to consider is durability. Doing true speed work is violent (i.e., impact &#8211; force upon landing, dynamic movement &#8211; tendons under a high load); need to work into it.</li>
<li>Start with strides (even a really good 200-meter program starts with tempos)</li>
<li>Then, build into relaxed sprints (grounding workouts); continue to develop</li>
<li>Once you reach your near top end, sprint for 30 meters; but Lucho says not to worry too much about this (he doesn&#8217;t think you need to work on true speed)</li>
<li>Strides and timing 100 meters will be plenty for you</li>
<li>Timing is really important &#8211; it drives intent!</li>
<li>One of Lucho&#8217;s favorite workouts is the ladder workout</li>
<li>If you want to focus on critical speed, running 40-70km a week is going to ruin that (you can&#8217;t run 70k a week and develop critical speed effectively; you can improve it, but you can&#8217;t top it out)</li>
<li>Start with strides; spend 4 weeks focusing on the 100. Don&#8217;t drop weekly volume.</li>
<li>Do a really long warm-up!
<ul>
<li>An example of Lucho&#8217;s warm-up:
<ul>
<li>400 easy</li>
<li>Lunges, isometric wall sits, seven-way hips, isometric hamstring holds, single-leg RDLs, hopping, hip/leg swings</li>
<li>20-meter strides</li>
<li>40&#8217;s (timed)</li>
<li>1-3 x&#8217;s 100&#8217;s &#8211; building into each. Start out easy and relaxed, last 40-50 meters max effort (not forced!)</li>
<li>Once Lucho feels feel ready, then he&#8217;ll start the workout.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t overthink it too much!</li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Richard asks:</b></h2>
<h3><b>Heat&#8217;s one thing, what about excessive heat?</b></h3>
<div>
<div>I started to listening to the ATC show last fall while training for my next (5th) marathon. Love the show and feel like I can relate to a lot of the questions that are answered. The Coronavirus has changed my training plan from being aggressive (trying to prep for a marathon PR) to more of a maintain mode.</div>
<div></div>
<div>My question centers around training in excessive heat/humidity. I live in Alexandria Virginia (near the Potomac River) and we&#8217;ve had a record hot July, with most days over 90 degrees (including I think 19 straight days) with high to very high humidity. I have struggled to maintain my normal training paces (I&#8217;m going 20-30 seconds slower pace per mile on most days). I get that it&#8217;s more difficult to run in high heat and humidity, but was wondering if there&#8217;s an &#8220;agreed upon&#8221;/common distance equivale<wbr />nt for running in such conditions&#8230;for example running 7 miles in current challenging northern Virginia weather conditions (90-95+ degrees with high to very high humidity) is &#8220;equivalent&#8221; to running 10 miles in &#8220;normal&#8221; northern Virginia weather conditions (~75 to 80 degrees with low to moderate humidity)? I guess I&#8217;m partially just searching for an excuse as to why I&#8217;ve struggled so much (slow pace, heavy legs, needing to stop to rest [normally I don&#8217;t stop]) during runs this late June and July.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Data about me: I turn 51 this year and have been running for about 4 years. My normal training run pace is about 7:30 per mile (not tempo/interval/speed, that&#8217;s obviously at a faster pace). I race distances from 5k (18:35 PR) to marathons (2:58:20 PR) on roads, and run in 5- and -10 mile trail series races too.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I&#8217;d appreciate your thought on this issue.</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 dir="auto"><strong>What the Coaches say:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Excessive and consistent heat training detracts from the quality of training. But the coaches think you&#8217;re getting fitter!</li>
<li>If you were to run in cooler weather all of a sudden, you&#8217;d see improvements</li>
<li>Training in this type of heat equates to high altitude training</li>
<li>You build mental toughness and grit training in the heat</li>
<li>Emerging research is showing that hen training in the heat excess ammonia is produced in the muscles. This ammonia goes up to the brain and can cross the blood-brain barrier
<ul>
<li>Extra ammonia accumulation can cause a disruption in cerebral neurotransmitter homeostasis (i.e., decrease cerebral function)</li>
<li>The removal of ammonia is dependant on the synthesis of glutamine from glutamate (which is a precursor for GABA)</li>
<li>Therefore, exercising in the heat possibly decrease healthy neurotransmitters</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The evaporation of sweat off our body cools us down; this isn&#8217;t happening as efficiently in the humidity</li>
<li>Your pace may possibly be the same!</li>
<li>Keep an eye on your heart rate</li>
<li>Balance is key here &#8211; don&#8217;t push it too hard</li>

<h3><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/9/3041/htm">Benefits of Creatine Supplementation for Vegetarians Compared to Omnivorous Athletes: A Systematic Review</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>“Creatine supplementation in vegetarians increased total creatine, creatine, and phosphocreatine concentrations in vastus lateralis and gastrocnemius muscle, plasma, and red blood cells, often to levels greater than omnivores. <strong>Creatine supplementation had no effect on brain levels of phosphocreatine. Creatine supplementation increased lean tissue mass, type II fiber area, insulin-like growth factor-1, muscular strength, muscular endurance, Wingate mean power output, and brain function (memory and intelligence) in vegetarian participants. S</strong>tudies were mixed on whether creatine supplementation improved exercise performance in vegetarians to a greater extent compared to omnivores.”</li>
<li>Also a supercompensation effect?</li>
<li>“Creatine supplementation in vegetarians is effective for increasing creatine and phosphocreatine levels to an extent that vegetarians may achieve higher levels of creatine and phosphocreatine after supplementation, compared to omnivores (i.e., it appears that the lower baseline levels in vegetarians might allow for “super compensation” of creatine or phosphocreatine levels with supplementation; see <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/9/3041/htm#table_body_display_ijerph-17-03041-t001"><strong>Table 1</strong></a>). For example, five to seven days of creatine supplementation (at a dose of about 20–25 g/day) results in greater increases in plasma creatine [<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/9/3041/htm#B36-ijerph-17-03041"><strong>36</strong></a>], vastus lateralis total creatine [<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/9/3041/htm#B37-ijerph-17-03041"><strong>37</strong></a>], and gastrocnemius phosphocreatine [<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/9/3041/htm#B33-ijerph-17-03041"><strong>33</strong></a>] concentrations in vegetarians versus omnivores,</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Creatine for endurance athletes? </strong>
<ul>
<li>Creatine can be used as an energy source for ATP synthesis.</li>
<li>Benefits are not as strong for endurance athletes as they are for strength/power athletes, but some studies point to evidence of benefit, such as a glycogen sparing effect, and loads of anecdotal evidence on its benefit.</li>
<li>Creatine mentions on Endurance Planet (click this link or search keyword creatine on our site).</li>
<li>For EA’s using creatine may be more about the “indirect” benefits one might find e.g.:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0765159715000039">Effects of short-term creatine supplementation and resistance exercises on resting hormonal and cardiovascular responses</a></li>
<li>“Results of the present study suggest that more than 5 days of creatine supplementation, associated with resistance exercises is sufficient for increasing testosterone concentrations and decrement in cortisol concentrations.”</li>
<li><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18826587/">Also: one study showed that creatine for EAs may be able to reduce RPE and improve physiological markers during exercise</a>(e.g. lower HR in heat).</li>
<li>May decrease muscle wasting in older populations (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6518405/">review of studies</a>).</li>
<li><a href="https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1550-2783-8-24">But also there are studies of no profound effect</a>of creatine.</li>
<li>Side effects may include fluid retention, but maybe this is a good thing for hydration status in heat?</li>
<li>Note really much downside to trying and seeing for yourself!</li>

<h3><a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12602-020-09656-5.pdf">Probiotic Administration Increases Amino Acid Absorption from Plant Protein: a Placebo-Controlled, Randomized, Double-Blind, Multicenter, Crossover Study</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>This study looked at “nutritional strategies to raise the blood amino acid concentrations after ingesting a plant protein source to overcome compositional shortcomings.”</li>
<li>“Compared with animal protein sources, plant protein sources, with the exception of soy protein, are incomplete proteins lacking in one or more essential amino acids. Plant proteins contain less branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), especially leucine [13], one of the crucial amino acids for muscle health, especially the activation of muscle protein synthesis (MPS) [14]. In addition, plant proteins differ in absorption kinetics and the amount of amino acids absorbed by the host.”</li>
<li>“Pea protein is low in methionine and contains lower amounts of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), which play a crucial role in muscle health.</li>
<li>“certain probiotic strains have proteolytic properties and have been linked to an increased production of digestive enzymes and subsequently improved host protein utilization [12].”</li>
<li>Probiotic L. paracasei LP- DG® and L. paracasei LPC- S01 have promising effects and were used in this study because they have been shown to increase absorption of key nutrients of specific importance to athletes, such as amino acids from protein.</li>
<li>“Fifteen physically active men co-ingested 20 g of pea protein with either AminoAltaTM, a multi-strain probiotic or a placebo for 2 weeks in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design, separated by a 4-week washout period.</li>
<li>“Probiotic administration significantly increased methionine, histidine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, tyrosine, total BCAA, and total EAA maximum concentrations (Cmax) and AUC without significantly changing the time to reach maximum concentrations. Probiotic supplementation can be an important nutritional strategy to improve postprandial changes in blood amino acids and to overcome compositional shortcomings of plant proteins.”</li>
<li>“The co-administration of probiotics with pea protein increased methionine AUC levels by 20% in our study, offering an alternative nutritional approach to overcome the low methionine content in pea protein.”</li>
<li><strong>Some take-home points:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The more support and strength you have in your microbiome the more dietary protein will get digested and utilized. Adding a probiotic, prebiotic and a way to increase stomach acid is a great strategy for most people.</li>
<li>Need good levels of Hcl also if you want to absorb dietary protein, as it is needed to convert inactive pepsinogen to active pepsin, the stomach enzyme that digest protein.</li>
<li>Not sure if you’re protein deficient? Symptoms to watch for:
<ul>
<li>Fluid retention</li>
<li>Dizziness or nausea</li>
<li>Cuticles tear easily</li>
<li>Muscle wasting</li>
<li>Low hormone levels</li>
<li>Poor coordination</li>
<li>Overall weakness</li>
<li>Colds, flu, infections easily</li>
<li>Premature aging</li>
<li>Dull hair, dry hair, or hair falling out</li>

<h2><strong>Eric asks:</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Eliminating Lectins for Autoimmunity?</strong></h3>
<p>My wife is a marathon runner and we’re learning that she likely has the onset of an autoimmune condition (we are awaiting the diagnosis but it’s pretty certain either lupus or RA). In starting to research for her in natural ways to heal I’ve come across the role of lectins and read that a low lectin diet has a therapeutic effect on autoimmune conditions. Have you guys heard of this? I know Julie has been doing a lot of experimenting with her own diet to alleviate some issues. Curious to hear a discussion. And also, for those without autoimmunity, is it still a good idea to avoid lectins? How does the 80/20 type approach apply to this stuff. Like if she were to have gluten once in a while is that a hard no or maybe ok?</p>
<p>Any other tips on training modifications, or nutritional interventions would be great!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>What the Coaches Say:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Lectins defined: a protein that binds to sugar molecules in cells throughout the body altering their function. They are part of a natural defense against microorganisms, pests, and insects.</li>
<li>Symptoms of lectin overload: swelling, digestive trouble, gas/bloating, brain fog, weight gain.</li>
<li>Lectins and their possible role in autoimmune disease: lectins can strip away the mucous coat of the small intestine leaving it vulnerable for an overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria.</li>
<li>There is emerging research on the link between lectins and their role in autoimmunity but nothing is “proven” at this point.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1115436/">Do Dietary Lectins Cause Disease?</a>
<ul>
<li>“Of particular interest is the implication for autoimmune diseases. Lectins stimulate class II HLA antigens on cells that do not normally display them, such as pancreatic islet and thyroid cells.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1115436/#B9">9</a>The islet cell determinant to which cytotoxic autoantibodies bind in insulin dependent diabetes mellitus is the disaccharide N-acetyl lactosamine,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1115436/#B10">10</a> which must bind tomato lectin if present and probably also the lectins of wheat, potato, and peanuts. This would result in islet cells expressing both class II HLA antigens and foreign antigen together—a sitting duck for autoimmune attack. Certain foods (wheat, soya) are indeed diabetogenic in genetically susceptible mice.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1115436/#B11">11</a> Insulin dependent diabetes therefore is another potential lectin disease and could possibly be prevented by prophylactic oligosaccharides.”</li>
<li>In other words: lectins have binding properties that can cause intestinal permeability, disrupt digestion, cause nutrient deficiencies, and all around cause severe intestinal damage WHEN CONSUMED IN EXCESS (or genetically susceptible). This damage to the gut creates intestinal permeability which we know is the gateway to various autoimmunity. We need our mucosal layer healthy so it can moderate the absorption of nutrients and water and to prevent harmful substances from entering our bloodstream.</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Plant Paradox Diet
<ul>
<li>This is another low-lectin diet resource by Dr. Gundry, who says “Plants don’t want to be eaten. They simply want to survive. One of the ways they defend themselves against hungry animals like us is by producing toxic chemical compounds – proteins known as lectins. And when lectins invade our bodies, they can cause some serious inflammatory responses and other health issues, like leaky gut syndrome, weight gain, brain fog, and more.”</li>
<li>Abstract: <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/circ.137.suppl_1.p238"><strong>Remission/Cure of Autoimmune Diseases by a Lectin Limited Diet Supplemented With Probiotics, Prebiotics, and Polyphenols (Gundry; 2018) </strong></a>
<ul>
<li>NOTE: <em>This was a simply presentation at an AHA conference not a peer-reviewed published study.</em></li>
<li>“95/102 patients achieved complete resolution of autoimmune markers and inflammatory markers within 9 months. The other 7/102 patients all had reduced markers, but incomplete resolution. 80/102 patients were weaned from all immunosuppressive and/or biologic medications without rebound.</li>
<li>“We conclude that a lectin limited diet, supplemented with pro and prebiotics, and polyphenols are capable of curing or putting into remission most autoimmune diseases.”</li>

<li><a href="https://drgundry.com/dr-gundrys-print-friendly-yes-no-lists/"> Grundy’s approved foods vs not approved foods due to lectin content</a>.</li>
<li>Interesting things we noticed on this list:
<ul>
<li>The focus on resistant starches instead of grains as carb sources</li>
<li>Veg focus can be: Cruciferous and leafy greens largely ok</li>
<li>What about oxalates in greens?</li>
<li>Carrot greens- a little known thing you can keep &amp; eat!</li>
<li>Some foods like cucumber are ok with seeds/skin removed</li>
<li>Nuts at a ½ cup day are ok as nut flours (dose matters!)</li>
<li>Many plant-based proteins are on the “no” list (soy, tofu, TVP, edamame, etc.)</li>
<li>Not allowed: non-southern European cow’s milk products (lol)</li>
<li>Also being mindful of animal-based proteins: what does the animal’s diet looks like?! Go for grassfed/pastured, avoid grain or soybean fed animals.
<ul>
<li>This one is hard because it can get expensive to exclusively eat all pastured, e.g. we eat organic chicken but not always pastured.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One way to go about this is to look at the “no” list and see what foods you may be eating a lot of regularly and maybe look to modify there to begin, while adding more of the “yes” foods.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Actionable steps:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Start by eliminating the heavy hitters: Gluten, Nightshades, Beans/Legumes, Peanuts</li>
<li>If seeing a reduction in symptoms, but are still uncomfortable, keep trying to eliminate others.</li>
<li>What about gluten every so often? Is there a reaction? Then probably should stay away. Depends on the severity! But any reaction, even low grade, will probably be worth it to really minimize it because there is obviously a reaction occurring and the body is stressed.</li>
<li>One of the big factors to destabilize lectins is using something like a pressure cooker and/or peeling and deseeding… or just not eating them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Lectins okay with people without Autoimmunity?
<ul>
<li>If you have any of the symptoms above and these foods are frequent in your diet, it’d be worth a shot to get rid of some, test on yourself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Also consider: Training Modifications:
<ul>
<li>Give the gut a break and chance to heal without the jostling of long-distance running</li>
<li>Pick a couple months to really ease up, and see if your flares decrease.</li>
<li>We know blood flow is diverted to our skin and muscles during long or high-intensity work.</li>
<li>This will increase gut permeability and delay healing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Lucho Rapid Fires:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Where did you get the nickname Lucho?
<ul>
<li>Last name used to be Luchinski. Somewhere around 2004, a cycling training partner started calling him &#8220;Lucho&#8221; instead of Luchinski, and it stuck. (He since changes his last name, but &#8220;Lucho&#8221; still sticks).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Coffee or no coffee before a workout?
<ul>
<li>Yes! But Lucho warns against becoming addicted or using it to mask extreme fatigue.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re new to coffee, don&#8217;t overdo it.</li>
<li>Decaf is a great way to feel some of the psychological benefits of coffee without a big caffeine spike.</li>
<li>Buy fresh (preferably organic) beans</li>
<li>Considering weaning off coffee two weeks before an A race. Then you can have coffee on race day and really feel it!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lucho&#8217;s favorite post-workout meal?
<ul>
<li>60 grams of organic whey protein isolate after the workout with walnuts, almonds, peanuts, and raisins at lunch later. If the workout is super long and intense, he&#8217;ll add 60 grams of carbs to his bottle during the workout.</li>
<li><a href="https://mtcapra.com/ref/jysnzyq/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mt. Capra</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mention for non-cow whey protein (comes from goats and their <a href="https://mtcapra.com/product/deep-2-30/ref/enduranceplanet/">Deep 30</a> protein includes electrolytes and probiotic).</span></li>

They get down to the track with a stopwatch and flog their guts out thinking that it’ll make them a champion, but they’ll never make a champion that way.</a>”— Arthur Lydiard
<ul>
<li>The American system is premised on brutalizing yourself from the age of 13 past college to the pro level. Instead, Lucho thinks you need to spend all that time building your base and becoming durable at high volume. Then, when you&#8217;re &#8220;bulletproof&#8221; you can go hard.</li>
<li>Lucho also thinks there&#8217;s a sociological component. In Kenya/Ethiopia, every athletic hero is a runner. In the US, 10-year-olds are idolizing NFL players. Running isn&#8217;t encouraged in this country.</li>

<h2><b>Anonymous asks:</b></h2>
<h3><b>Do vasectomies negatively affect athletic performance?</b></h3>
<div>
<p>Good morning,</p>
<div dir="auto">Big fan of the show and long time listener. Not sure if this fits in with ATC or more in HPN?</div>
<div dir="auto"></div>
<div dir="auto">Basically my wife and I have been discussing me getting a vasectomy as we don&#8217;t want children. I appreciate that it&#8217;s not the same as when you neuter a racehorse, but I guess I&#8217;m still concerned about how it may affect my sports performance.</div>
<div dir="auto"></div>
<div dir="auto">I&#8217;m a competitive AG athlete (31 years old) and was trying to get an elite ticket in the world of XTERRA/ cross triathlon until COVID happened, so fingers crossed 2021 goes a bit more to plan. My concerns are that having this surgery may jeopardise my performance in my athletic journey, but I am also interested to get your thoughts on wider health/ exercise longevity impact in the long term?</div>
</div>
<h3 dir="auto"><strong>What the Coaches say:</strong></h3>
<div dir="auto">
<ul>
<li>No, there is no performance drop-off (because you&#8217;re not being castrated). There will be no change in testosterone or any other hormonal change.</li>
<li>Lucho recommends not getting the vas deferens clip in the procedure. Just do cauterization.</li>
<li>In his experience, the anxiety of going into the procedure was way worse than the procedure itself. It only takes about 4 minutes and is totally painless.</li>
<li>Take the recovery seriously (two weeks totally off!).</li>
<li>Research studies
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30356207/">Long-term safety, health and mental status in men with vasectomy</a></li>

<ul>
<li>Sperm changes, obviously, but “early bilateral vasectomy does not strongly affect the endocrine function of the testis.” This was in rats.</li>

<ul>
<li>“Evidence strongly suggests that your facilities will remain fully operational, your sex life will improve (or at least stay the same), and your testosterone levels will be unaffected. All they’re doing is capping the vas deferens – the tubes that deliver sperm during ejaculation. You can still ejaculate, and the &#8216;body&#8217; is none the wiser. You’re just ‘inactive.’”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Note that vasectomies can fail (like a &lt;10% chance but it&#8217;s possible so just fyi).</li>

<h2><b>Vicky asks:</b></h2>
<h3><b>Comparing bike training to run training and negotiating days off?</b></h3>
<div>
<div>Hi Tawnee and Lucho!</div>
<div></div>
<div>I hope you are both doing well &#8211; listening to your podcast, it would seem that you are.  I&#8217;m one of the few athletes to be relieved to have my races cancelled, as I wasn&#8217;t doing too well recovering from a skydiving injury.  All is good now, but I&#8217;m in the phase of clawing my way back to being in good running shape.</div>
<div></div>
<div>My questions are simple, so I&#8217;ll ask them first, then give you more background than you probably need, but I often hear you wondering things about people who have asked questions, and hopefully I&#8217;ll cover anything you might want to know.</div>
<div></div>
<div>1)  When I train on my bike, should I use the same training philosophy that I do when I run?  Hard days/easy days, long rides, short rides with hard intervals, tempo rides, etc? (Please talk about how a hard bike affects running and vice versa if you would as well.)</div>
<div></div>
<div>2)  Do I need a complete day off if I take two relatively easy days in a row?</div>
<div></div>
<div>Here&#8217;s my background:</div>
<div></div>
<div>I&#8217;m a 61 year old female, and I&#8217;ve been racing and training most of my life.  High School swimmer, then not much till I joined the Army at 23 years old.  Then I got into running and triathlon (I&#8217;m almost a pioneer in that one!), completing my first marathon at age 25 without much guidance except run a lot!  (Time was 4:19, and I slept around the clock afterwards!)</div>
<div></div>
<div>I took a few years off from racing to have children, then started back again in my late thirties.  Got really serious about training in my late 40&#8217;s, and hit most of my PRs from 5K to Marathon in mid-fifties.  After that, I suffered a lot of injuries and surgeries for various things (including a broken foot running into the ocean for a triathlon).  I realize now some were injuries due to increasing mileage too rapidly.  That was the year I got all my PRs!</div>
<div></div>
<div>Currently I&#8217;m recovered from the sky diving thing (a hard landing that my knee took the brunt of) except for a large lump that remains below my kneecap.  I&#8217;ve had some foot issues that I now realize was from wearing stability shoes and switching to zero drop Altras without a good transition period.  Feet are finally adjusting, and I&#8217;m up to 20 to 25 miles a week running.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I am currently signed up for an Olympic Triathlon set for October.  I&#8217;m training on the assumption that it will happen, but I&#8217;m fine if it doesn&#8217;t.  Like Lucho, I just enjoy the process of training.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In an effort to heal my feet, as well as prevent a hip issue (piriformis?) that I&#8217;ve had in the past, I have limited my running to 4 times a week.  But I have a very hard time taking a day off, so I bike on the other days.  Here&#8217;s what my week looks like:</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Monday</strong> &#8211; run 5 miles very easy, sometimes on a treadmill</div>
<div><strong>Tuesday</strong> &#8211; bike inside on my trainer for an hour, doing mostly very short intervals (20 to 35 seconds) with the same recovery for an hour</div>
<div><strong>Wednesday</strong>  &#8211; run 6 miles, in a progression run, gradually getting a bit faster. The last mile includes 6 very short hill sprints.  I&#8217;m working up to a full blown interval workout, but taking it slow getting there.</div>
<div><strong>Thursday</strong> &#8211; bike outside 20 miles, average pace around 18 mph</div>
<div><strong>Friday</strong> &#8211; run 5 miles in the rolling crests (can&#8217;t call them hills) around my house, easy pace</div>
<div><strong>Saturday</strong> &#8211; long run of 8 to 10 miles, using run 2 min, walk 30 seconds, fairly easy pace</div>
<div><strong>Sunday</strong> &#8211; Long bike, 30 miles (that&#8217;s long for me at this point!) at pretty much the same pace as the Thursday bike</div>
<div></div>
<div>One interesting note from my many years of training, is that the last few years I&#8217;ve gotten much slower at running, but my biking and swimming haven&#8217;t changed much, and may actually be a bit better.  I know the swimming is due to my extensive study of good technique, which is why I also want to apply better technique to my biking.  I&#8217;m not swimming at the moment, but will add that in later as swimming comes very easy to me.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Thanks for your help.  I hope I covered everything important!</div>
</div>
<h3><strong>What the Coaches say:</strong></h3>
<div>
<ul>
<li>The basic physiology is the same between bike and run, but the main difference is that cycling isn&#8217;t load bearing so you can do more volume.</li>
<li>A hard run is going to affect the bike more than a hard bike will affect the run (because running beats you up more).</li>
<li>The majority of triathletes hire a coach because it&#8217;s hard to blend the two!</li>
<li>Doubling up is essential in tri training.</li>
<li>Check out Cherie Gruenfeld as bad ass master athlete: <a style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;" href="https://www.enduranceplanet.com/cherie-gruenfeld-grandmaster-triathlete-racing-her-20th-ironman-world-championship-race-this-year-hear-her-story-and-tips-for-longevity-in-sport/">https://www.enduranceplanet.com/cherie-gruenfeld-grandmaster-triathlete-racing-her-20th-ironman-world-championship-race-this-year-hear-her-story-and-tips-for-longevity-in-sport/</a></li>
<li>Lucho thinks your 5 mile &#8220;easy&#8221; runs are too challenging, given your long run is 8 to 10.</li>
<li>Instead of running easy on Friday, double up and do your run after the bike on Thursday. Take Friday off. Total days off are essential.</li>
<li>You could swim 1K max on recovery days.</li>
<li>Switching to time versus miles can help ensure you don&#8217;t overdo it.</li>

<h3><b>Runner’s knee woes</b></h3>
<p>Hey guys, just recently started listening to your show and have really enjoyed it so far. I’ve got a question for you regarding runner’s knee and how to go about treating it.</p>
<p>A little bit about me: I’m 27 and relatively new to running (a little over 2 years). I’ve done a few half marathons and usually try to run 15-20 miles a week. I had plantar fasciitis issues on my right foot about a year ago, but took some time off and got some insoles and haven’t had any problems since. I started to experience pain on the outer part of my left knee during my last run and even felt it lock up a couple times. I’ve taken about a week off to rest it, but I still have some lingering pain and stiffness on the outside of my knee and knee cap while walking. It happened on a shorter run where I was focused on improving my speed, so I was pushing it harder than I normally would. I was running in some new shoes and did not have the insoles in that I usually use. It was also only a couple weeks after my most recent half, so I might have been doing too much too soon. After looking around on the internet, it appears that my symptoms are pointing towards runners knee or IT band syndrome. I’ve been doing the “rice” treatment method which has helped a little bit, but I was wondering if you guys had any other treatment or prevention methods that may help. Or if you think it may be a different type of injury entirely. I was planning on doing another half in a couple of months, however I really don’t want to hurt myself any further so it may be in my best interest to sit this next race out to be safe. Any tips would be greatly appreciated. Really itching to get back out there!</p>
<h2><b>Also, Peter W. asks:</b></h2>
<h3><b>ITB problems and tugging on the knee</b></h3>
<p>Hi &#8211; Thank you so much for the podcast and everything that you do! I am a solid sub-8min MAF runner (32 years old) who typically logs between 35 and 50 miles a week.  I’ve recently developed a bad case of ITB syndrome which pulls on my left knee and inflames my left knee cap between miles 6 through 10 or so.  I’ve gone for a few sessions of active release which helps in the short term but I still get this issue now and again.  Serious sucks!,</p>
<p>Should I look at lungs/weighted step ups and rucking as ways to strengthen and improve this issue? More specific stretches possibly? I realize this is a very general question but would be interested into any insights you all on the podcast might have!</p>
<h3><strong>What The Sock Doc says:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Potential gait issues</li>
<li>Insoles/cushions are okay when it comes to someone healing an issue like plantar fasciitis</li>
<li>RICE: rest, ice, compression, elevation.
<ul>
<li>Rest (to a certain degree). Prefer active recovery vs. passive.</li>
<li>Icing is usually not recommended anymore; may even delay healing. The exception would be to ice something using the cryokinetic method (i.e., icing the area so you can mobilize it better).</li>
<li>Compression is the most beneficial. May compress the affected area or massage around it.</li>
<li>Elevation may help with swelling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://sock-doc.com/sock-doc-treatment-prevention-of-itb-syndrome/">Sock Doc&#8217;s Video: Treatment and Prevention of ITB Syndrome</a></li>
<li>Consider the holistic components (e.g., stress levels outside of running, nutrition, sleep, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Rory Campbell asks:</b></h2>
<h3><b>First Achilles now Chondromalacia patellae got me</b></h3>
<p>Hi guys, Rory from Scotland here. I hope you’re all staying safe and well? Pretty much all of our events have been cancelled for the foreseeable future so I guess it’s time that we can focus on strength building, staying fit and healthy.</p>
<p>Before covid-19 hit us I was having difficulties with Achilles pain and so I focussed on building strength around the Achilles, my legs, core etc. Stopped running and instead hit the gym. In the process of strength building I managed to hurt my right shoulder (maybe doing rdl’s) which is still bad but more significantly a knee niggle came back to haunt me. I had noticed it occasionally on long runs last year but did not impact on my day to day life or running plans. I had a few big ultras last year that culminated in the transalpine run in September. Plans for this year included an 80mile event and some other interesting bits and bobs. All changed now, of course. So the MRI shows Chondromalacial patellae, I’ve rested but also am conscious of not resting, if that makes sense. I can’t run because it gets aggravated. Cycling also seems to aggravate it unless it’s a very light spin on the turbo for 30-40 minutes. Likewise the cross-trainer (elliptical). My shoulder still hurts so some strength excercises I can’t do. Squats also aggravate it. I’m following a 24hour rule &#8211; try something, if it hurts the next day then pull back again. I have it taped up, have taken ibuprofen and have iced it. I am very frustrated as all I want is to head out to the hills close to my house and maintain/grow my fitness again. Everything I have read suggests this will get better with time but I’m not seeing it yet. I feel it in my knee just walking around.</p>
<p>Can you suggest some movement strategies or exercises?</p>
<h3><strong>What The Sock Doc says:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Possible inflammation from training too hard/often (overtrained), or not recovering properly.</li>
<li>Try for a holistic health assessment.</li>
<li>You may want to hold off on the 80-mile event for now</li>
<li>Focus on getting healthier; think about what is running your body down. You want to be able to run pain-free!</li>
<li>Sock Doc&#8217;s <a href="http://sock-doc.com/">website</a> includes information on virtual consultations, contact information, etc. if you&#8217;d like to work with a professional!</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Female-specific:</b></h2>
<p>Women in perimenopause and menopause feeling knee soreness and pinch type feelings in the knee that wasn’t there before. Is this a factor of making this hormonal transition?</p>
<h3><strong>What The Sock Doc says:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Previous <a href="https://www.enduranceplanet.com/sock-doc-9-mastering-melatonin-and-sleep-without-supplementing-being-weary-of-cbd-hypermobile-athletes-and-the-estrogen-connection-and-more/">podcast episode</a> with the Sock Doc
<ul>
<li>High estrogen or low progesterone in women could cause ligament instability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hormonal imbalance symptoms are common, but not normal.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Supplements:</b></h2>
<p>For those wanting to run marathon or longer and experiencing knee pain on long runs over 10 miles or so… or if by 18-20 miles the ache is unbearable. What’s going on? Will something like glucosamine help? Fish oil? What other supplements?</p>
<h3><strong>What The Sock Doc says:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Never take a supplement to try and run through pain!</li>
<li>First, you need to figure out why you can&#8217;t run!</li>
<li>Fish oil can act as an anti-inflammatory.</li>
<li>If you take NSAIDs and you feel better, that is pretty much telling you that you have a fatty acid imbalance.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Lucho Rapid Fire Questions:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><u>Altitude masks:</u> are they actually effective and worth it to adapt to high altitude conditions?
<ul>
<li>From a physiological standpoint, no.</li>
<li>In Lucho&#8217;s opinion, though, they can have a beneficial psychological effect. The masks make it more difficult to breathe, so training with it allows you to get more comfortable with this feeling (which is similar to what you experience at altitude).</li>
<li>Side note: do not use a mask if exercising while pregnant!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><u>Running power meters:</u> are they accurate/reliable/valid data, and worth the investment? Useful as another metric, and/or as an alternative to HR? What about prescribing &#8220;target power ranges&#8221; for run workouts as you would watts on the bike?
<ul>
<li>Lucho thinks they have the potential to be just as useful as a power meter on the bike.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re not a data person, don&#8217;t worry about using it (Lucho doesn&#8217;t).</li>
<li>From a data guidance and tracking perspective, they&#8217;re incredibly useful.</li>
<li>The devices will probably continue to get more accurate over time.</li>
<li><a href="https://feetmesport.com/en/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FeetMe</a> and <a href="https://www.rpm2.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RPM2</a> measure force at the foot level. This is similar to an SRM, and should be more viable than an algorithm.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><u>Sub-max fitness tests to predict max HR:</u> What do you think about using the sub-max HR tests (<a href="https://howtobefit.com/determine-maximum-heart-rate.htm">like this from Sally Edwards</a>) to predict max HR? Looks like she recommends doing 4 of the sub-max and averaging them, and also doing her calc.
<ul>
<li>Lucho isn&#8217;t a fan of using max HR to set your zones; there&#8217;s not really a correlation between max HR and LT.</li>
<li>HR is a variable datapoint, so take it with a grain of salt.</li>
<li>Rather than using a max HR test to set your zones, do your long run, keep it chill, and use your average HR to set your zone 2 (+/-5).</li>
<li>Joe Friel&#8217;s 20-30 min LT test is another effective way to set your zones.</li>
<li>Keep in mind that energy systems are on a spectrum and you switch over gradually. You don&#8217;t suddenly shift from LT to VO2 the second you go over LT.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Anonymous asks:</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Preconception fitness and health</strong></h3>
<p>Hi Tawnee and Endurance Planet Team!</p>
<p><strong>My short question is:</strong> how can I build my aerobic base based on my SLOW progression with MAF, and push my aerobic endurance, in a healthy way as we begin to try to conceive?</p>
<p><strong>Context: </strong>The longer version is that I have run on and off &#8211; VERY slowly and with poor training techniques &#8211; since 2012, but never much stuck with it besides perhaps a once yearly training for a 10k. I broke my femur in December 2018, and by June 2019 began Orange Theory, where I built up from walking on the treadmill to finally being able to run for short bursts again. This got me hooked on heart rate monitoring, and I ran my first post-break 5k in October 2019; I also took a MAF test. I&#8217;ve done a few 5ks since then &#8211; my time varies between about 38-45 minutes for a 5k. (I don&#8217;t run at my husband&#8217;s pace!! I&#8217;m more of a completion ribbon gal).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been my goal to get in good physical fitness to recover from the break/build strength, be generally healthy, but also to build a good base for pre-conception health; we want to begin trying for a baby this summer, and know this can be such an unpredictable journey.</p>
<p>But while Orange Theory was pushing my fitness and I was improving quickly, I realized in April when the world shut down that my aerobic fitness was not increasing. I ran a 3 mile MAF test in October 2019 at a target heart rate of 146 (I&#8217;m 34) with an average pace of 16:18 min miles. In April 2020, my average was 18:54 min miles.</p>
<p>After I saw in my April MAF test that my times increased, I began training with 30-45 minute runs 6 days a week, expecting my fitness to improve; it did not (at least much &#8211; I went to 18:17 min miles in May, and just today did cut down to a 17:31 minute mile average.</p>
<p>So: the last few weeks, I&#8217;ve been sticking to many MAF runs with a few others worked in. I&#8217;m so slow on MAF runs (18-20 min miles) that I feel like I&#8217;m walking backwards, and I&#8217;m being patient anyway, but it feels like I could lose fitness? I&#8217;m trying 3-4 MAF runs a week, with some sprints at the end. I&#8217;m maintaining 2 5k runs a week in which I just run at a fun pace, which results in an average heart rate of between 170-180. My 5k heart rate averages are beginning to decrease by just a touch, and I just ran my fastest 5k time since my leg break at 36 min. I did a long MAF warmup and a MAF cooldown as well.</p>
<p><strong>The longer version of the question<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Is it beneficial to mix in some MAF training with other runs like this? And &#8212; as we begin trying for a baby, and if I get pregnant- would it be best to train purely at MAF so that I&#8217;m keeping my heartrate down? This past year has been the most intense physical &#8220;training&#8221; of my life &#8211; I&#8217;ve never done long endurance running or played sports, so I can&#8217;t quite tell if I have a &#8220;baseline&#8221; of fitness, like other more intensely trained athletes do. I&#8217;m just wondering about the best approach for building/maintaining fitness in a healthy way during a possible pregnancy, given my context.</p>
<p>YIKES what a wordy question/essay.</p>
<p>Thanks for all of the great podcast episodes!</p>
<h3><strong>What the Coaches say:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>If your MAF isn&#8217;t improving given how much training you&#8217;re doing, you might want to look at other aspects of your life.
<ul>
<li>How&#8217;s your diet and blood sugar levels? Consider tweaking calories and macros.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t be extreme in either dietary direction&#8230; don&#8217;t eat too many carbs and don&#8217;t be keto.</li>
<li>What&#8217;s your stress like? If you&#8217;re in a chronically stressed state with high cortisol then your body might not respond well to training.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>170-180 is definitely an intense place to be, even if it feels fun.
<ul>
<li>HIIT and infertility
<ul>
<li>There are no published randomized controlled clinical trials on this to my knowledge.</li>
<li>There was a Norwegian study from a number of years ago that looked at reported exercise frequency and intensity and did find a link to lower pregnancy rates in the group with the highest frequency of intense exercise. This was a longitudinal retrospective study and does not show cause and effect. And I believe that group of women eventually did get pregnant, it just was later on………</li>
<li>“The biggest impact of exercise on fertility, whether it be endurance or HIIT-type workouts, is that if a woman is getting her period regularly every month that’s a great sign of hormones likely in balance and should increase chances of getting pregnant (all other factors taken into consideration of course).</li>
<li>If she is struggling with infertility already she might want to cut down on the high intensity workouts (to once or twice per week max) to do everything she can to improve her chances. But if just starting out and no signs of problems, no need to modify things (as long as her periods are good and she’s eating enough!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On HIIT in pregnancy
<ul>
<li>Again, no randomized controlled clinical trials.</li>
<li>I personally tell women they can continue doing the type of exercise they are used to doing, but the <b>intensity</b> needs to be modified during pregnancy.</li>
<li>Keeping the HR &lt;150bpm is an outdated rule written by men who don’t exercise, so I don’t go by that.  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
<li>Your resting heart rate is elevated in pregnancy and your exercise HR is also, linked to the increased cardiac output of pregnancy.  The best rule of thumb is to <b>use the perceived exertion scale</b> as a guide.
<ul>
<li>Exercising at low to moderate intensity is best.</li>
<li>Occasionally getting up to moderately hard is ok</li>
<li>Avoid the hard to very hard zone.</li>
<li>This applies in the first trimester and all the way through.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>RPE is a very valuable tool rather than just HR, but there are also some generally guidelines when it comes to HR. 170-180 is physiologically intense. Sure, 170 feels &#8220;fun,&#8221; but 160 would probably be safer.</li>
<li>Your comfort level matters so if you feel best sticking to MAF then do that but you don’t have to (I preferred sticking to my MAF range, which also aligned with my RPE).</li>
<li>Stick to a similar routine that you’ve been doing, not adding a bunch of new volume or intensity.</li>
<li>When TTC- Look at signs of health first e.g. hormones, regular period, stress balance, HPA axis, gut health, etc. If something’s off then address that which may require exercise modifications if the exercise is having any deleterious effect on the most important variables of fertility.
<ul>
<li>Not sure? Cycle tracking (ovulation, long enough luteal phase?), BBT, DUTCH test, cortisol panel, gut test if that’s a problem, etc. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>

<h2><strong>Chloe asks:</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Postpartum body care for athletic mamas?</strong></h3>
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Do you have any guidance on how to take care of your body post baby? Any websites/books On getting back into working out etc.  I look online &#8211; and there just seems to be so much junk (drink these shakes!  Pay 1000 for the perfect post baby body!) which I’m not interested in.</p>
<p>I’m hitting three weeks post baby, feeling good and have been just walking.  I’ve been listening to my body &#8211; but I just want to make sure I’m doing all I can do (in a smart way!)  I want to start lifting again and slowly getting back into running again!</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>
<h3><strong>What the Coaches say:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Get on your DR exercises, core/pelvic floor is everything! Even a few minutes daily makes a difference.</li>
<li>Breath work for DR: <a href="https://www.enduranceplanet.com/jill-miller-prevention-and-healing-of-diastasis-recti-during-pregnancy-and-postpartum-and-the-crucial-role-of-proper-breathing/">Jill Miller: Prevention and Healing of Diastasis Recti During Pregnancy and Postpartum and the Crucial Role of Proper Breathing</a></li>
<li>IG recommendation: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ajcorectology/">ajcorectology</a> for more DR exercises</li>
<li>Don’t overthink it. Like with the previous question, I think going by RPE is the best possible thing you can do and just shut out what other moms may or may not be doing after birth. I started with 1 mile….. then 2 miles… then by 4-5 months later I hammered out a 6k trail race and my HR was soaring but that was about right volume-wise for where I was at.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
<li>As I built back into volume I was sure to stick to mostly MAF because I felt like my metabolic function was all off and whacky after pregnancy. Some say pregnancy is a state of insulin resistance, by the way, which is an interesting concept. So I wanted to hone my metabolic function back in and it took a long time to get some breakthroughs with my MAF efforts.</li>
<li>Don’t stress over the “pressure” we place on ourselves and feel externally to get back to some level of pre-pregnancy fitness. Honor thy season you’re in—you are a mama now and that baby needs you first and foremost. I promise you’ll get it back with time.</li>
<li>From the health and holistic side, make sure you&#8217;re not pushing it too hard so your milk supplies diminishes prematurely.</li>

<p>Welcome to episode 19 of Holistic Performance Nutrition (HPN) featuring <a href="http://coachtawnee.com/">Tawnee Gibson</a>, MS, CSCS, CISSN, and Julie McCloskey, a certified holistic nutrition coach who you can find over at <a href="http://wildandwell.fit/">wildandwell.fit</a>.</p>
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Julie shares with us a bit about her journey with chilblains, and her experiment with a 30-day vegan diet. You may follow Julie along in her journey through her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_wildandwell/?hl=en">Instagram account</a>. She also wrote a blog titled <a href="http://wildandwell.fit/im-going-vegan-for-30-days-heres-why/">I&#8217;m Going Vegan for 30 Days, Here&#8217;s Why</a></p>
<p>On this episode:</p>
<p>Study: <a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00567.2019"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Potato ingestion is as effective as carbohydrate gels to support prolonged cycling performance</span></a></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The purpose of the present study was to assess the effectiveness of potato ingestion as a fueling strategy to support cycling time trial (TT) performance compared with CHO gel or water in trained cyclists.”</span></li>
<li> Study dynamics:
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Highly trained cyclists, averaging 165 miles a week, training for the past 7 years; subjects: 9 male, 3 females</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experimental trials were completed during the mid-follicular phase of the menstrual cycle for the female participants. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Randomized crossover design</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ingested 60g/CHO/hr during cycling challenge followed by TT to measure performance </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ate controlled meals 24hr pre-tests of macros: 60/20/20</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rode 2hr steady states 60% Vo2max combined with hill simulations at a higher intensity</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Took in 15g CHO every 15min from either potato puree or Powergel (120g CHO over 2hr), then did TT</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The individuals who chose the potato puree had more GI distress than the individuals who consumed the gels.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The overall GI symptoms were higher for potatoes than for the other conditions after the cycling challenge. Specifically, there were higher levels of abdominal pain, bloating, and discomfort during the late phases of the cycling challenge. </span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But average GI symptoms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were lower than in previous studies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> indicating that both CHO conditions were well tolerated by the majority of the study’s cyclists. It is worthwhile to mention that only two participants had previously chosen potatoes as their personal race fuel, <strong>but all participants regularly ingest CHO gels during races and training</strong>, and according to the gut training theory</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, frequency of ingestion could also alter digestibility and perceptions of fullness.&#8221;</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Potato has a different composition breakdown vs gel
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Potatoes are higher protein and fiber than gel</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Potato ingestion reduced gut damage, as indicated by similar reductions in plasma I-FABP concentrations between gel and potato vs. the water condition, throughout the exercise protocol.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
<li>The importance of training the gut</li>
<li>Potatoes are a low FODMAP option
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FODMAPS/Composition for 15g CHO worth of each:</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Potato is low fructose compared to gel but higher in glucose; both low galactose</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Potato puree is cheaper to make than buying gels</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2CvnoCA">humangear GoToob silicone bottles</a> (great for use as a gel flasks, toiletries, kid&#8217;s snacks, etc)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;TT performance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was significantly faster (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">P</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> = 0.032) in potato (33.0 ± 4.5 min) and gel (33.0 ± 4.2 min) conditions compared with the water condition (39.5 ± 7.9 min); however, no difference was observed between the potato and gel conditions (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">P</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> = 1.00).&#8221;</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Anu R. asks:</b></h2>
<h3><b>Chronic diarrhea (not just when running)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hi, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am a long time listener of Endurance Planet and I love the work that you do! My question is all digestion issues. Lot of poop talk here! (Feel free to shorten my question, I just wanted to give you enough info about my situation.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am a 40-year-old female triathlete, currently training for an Ironman. I have had issues with my frequent bowel movements for years but during this stay-at-home order I have had an opportunity to pay more attention. I poop on average 4 times a day, range between 2 and 6. Using the Bristol Stool Chart my poop is always diarrhea: it&#8217;s always mushy blobs or mostly liquid. Sorry if that&#8217;s TMI. Some resources say that this is a sign of the stool going through intestines too fast and nutrients not being absorbed. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I pay a lot of attention to my diet. I eat a lot of fruit and veggies and whole grains so lack of fiber should not be an issue. I get enough protein for my size and activity but I have a hard time recovering from my workouts, even though I sleep and take care of my body through light activity and body maintenance (yoga, foam rolling, etc.). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What can I do to make my intestines work at a normal pace? I have tried the Fodmap diet for about four weeks now but I see no change. I might be having a bit less bloating because I am eating less legumes but my bowel movements are still very frequent. I don&#8217;t feel sick but I think this is limiting my performance a lot. Sometimes I have so much bloating and discomfort in the afternoon that I skip my workout, especially if it&#8217;s a run. But the main problem is the trouble recovering, even though I think I&#8217;ve done my best to dial in training and recovery measures. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for your help!</span></p>
<h3><strong>What the Coaches say:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Both coaches recommend working with someone to hone in on the issue</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specific Carbohydrate diet for 30 days? Book/Founder </span><a href="http://www.breakingtheviciouscycle.info/home/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Breaking the Vicious Cycle”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Elaine Gotschall</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A diet low in the type of carbohydrates that don’t create digestive problems so the pathogens can be starved out and the damage to the mucosa can heal.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have gut issues and your not breaking down sugars properly, they will be used for microbes and increase the dysbiosis and damage to the mucosa.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not much science to back it up, but has been shown to help a lot of people with chronic digestion conditions find relief: IBS, celiac, Crohn&#8217;s, chronic diarrhea, diverticulitis.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goal: to improve digestion and absorption of nutrients so you feel like a human again. Super restrictive and not much scientific evidence, but if you want to try something new for 30 days, it might be worth a shot.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food allowed:</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fresh and frozen vegetables and legumes (soaked)</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exception of those high in starch: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">potatoes, sweet potatoes, yams, parsnips, chickpeas, bean sprouts, soybeans, mung beans, fava beans, and seaweed.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fresh, raw, or dried fruits (as long as no sugar is added)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meats, poultry, fish, eggs</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natural cheeses, homemade yogurt, dry curd cottage cheese</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not allowed:</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canned vegetables</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canned fruits, unless they are packed in their own juices</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All grains, including flour</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starchy vegetables</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Processed meats</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most dairy products</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sugars and sweeteners</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.diagnosticsolutionslab.com/tests/gi-map"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GI Stool test</span></a>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For something so chronic and debilitating would highly recommend investing in a GI stool test. Specifically, look for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">candida overgrowth or infections/parasites like giardia or cryptosporidium. In this kind of situation, probably best to get the <a href="https://www.diagnosticsolutionslab.com/tests/gi-map">GI MAP</a>, not GI Effects. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open water swimming (OWS) &#8211; potential parasites! Was there a time when you had a rather sudden onset of symptoms? Think back.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Need to confirm and or rule out one of these issues to target your healing plan.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other ideas:</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other life stress and/or a combination of exercise stress</span>
<ul>
<li>Play around with giving yourself some true relaxation! <span style="font-weight: 400;">If you ease up on training for 1, 2 even 3 weeks, do you notice a difference in stool quality? As usual, we need to address the stress component and how much it could be playing into this. And if you haven’t tried that at all, scale back to no more than 5-6 hours a week of MAF focus. The only intensity would be some strides (i.e. short non-fatiguing bouts).</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IgG food allergy test</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can be controversial but keep on your list if you keep coming up short on answers and solutions. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">From </span><a href="https://www.gdx.net/product/igg-food-antibodies-food-sensitivity-test-blood"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Genova</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The presence of circulating IgG antibodies to foods may be suggestive of increased intestinal permeability, also referred to as &#8220;leaky gut syndrome.&#8221; When the tight junctions forming the barrier in the gut don&#8217;t work properly, larger substances can &#8220;leak&#8221; through, causing an immune response. This immune response may result in the production of IgG antibodies to foods.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">4</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> There are multiple dietary and lifestyle factors that contribute to increased intestinal permeability. These factors include alcohol,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">13</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stress,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">14,15</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> chronic NSAID use,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">16</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Western-type diet (high consumption of red meat, animal fat, high sugar, and low fiber food),</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">17</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and prolonged and strenuous exercise.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span></li>

<h2><b>Amanda asks:</b></h2>
<h3><b>Athlete struggling with body</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As always, loving your podcast and so happy that you continue to release episodes throughout these crazy times. I always am so stoked to see an updated episode come through. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You featured my question almost a year ago now around athletic amenorrhea but to quickly recap &#8211; I am a 26 and am a competitive age grouper. I havent had my period in a few years but have experienced some weight loss that I attribute it to. At my heaviest, I was about 160lbs and am 5&#8217;7&#8243; (only sharing numbers because I know it helps tell the full story)- I started training for tris and lost some weight, then I started working with a nutritionist when my weight started to climb back up but my calories hadn&#8217;t matched that. I found out I wasn&#8217;t eating enough &#8211; enough of the right things at the right time or at all. So I increased my calories and really focused on timing around workouts and the pounds came off. At my lightest I was 115 (and admittedly this was way too light) so I bounced up to 125 where I feel like I hit a groove &#8211; PRs, felt confident, and was eating very strategically. I got tired of counting calories and concerned that its been almost 2 years since I had a menstrual cycle (they were never regular before but they are now absent). SO recently I&#8217;ve just tried to listen to what my body wants but also UP my calories &#8211; I try to hit 2500 a day as a baseline I&#8217;ve heard that&#8217;s the sweet spot to getting your period back. I eat relatively clean &#8211; tons of veggies and good clean carbs. I focus on lots of protein and a good amount of fat although I am definitely more of a carb/protein gal. I also rarely have processed foods and I really focus on eating to support my training which is anywhere from 13-20 hours per week. All this to say, I am very discouraged with what my results have been since trying to let go of the tracking and eat more to get to 2500 (as a baseline! so not including the long training days and intensity workouts). I&#8217;ve attached some photos (one of when I felt good and one of this week) I am sitting at about 131lbs right now and have gained a pound a week for the last several weeks. Is it stress? Is it eating too much? Would love any advice as it feels very out of control and I love to be in control &#8211; HA! I don&#8217;t want to have to count calories forever to be at a good healthy weight where I feel lean and happy. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, thanks for listening. Keep up the amazing work, love following this podcast and community.</span></p>
<h3><strong>What the Coaches say:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>It sounds like a lot of thought (and stress) is going into calories and working out</li>

<h2>Intro Discussion</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dopamine and screen time: <a href="www.twitch.tv/runnerLucho" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">learn more from Lucho on his Twitch</a>. Tips on how to guide your child&#8217;s athleticism and development.</li>

<h2><b>Josh asks:</b></h2>
<h3><b>Programming a triathlon base phase</b></h3>
<div>Hi, I am 38 years old and venturing into being self-coached with a little more structure rather than following random plans. I&#8217;m doing this as I transition from being mostly a runner who&#8217;s had fun but hasn&#8217;t been that serious about it, to now starting to train for triathlons (with the hope that we have options to races in early/mid- 2021). I plan to do Olympic and 70.3 next year and want to see how more quality training can get me closer to my potential.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Right now I want to make the commitment to base-phase training because that&#8217;s my weakness and what I need (especially the bike and swim) and am wondering does base mean ALL zone 1/zone 2, or do you include some intensity too, and if so how much or what types of high-intensity workouts make sense in a base phase? Is this an 80/20 kind of thing or 90/10? Or does it depend? (LOL). For the bike specifically, how do I work on improving my FTP in a base phase?</div>
<div></div>
<div>Secondly, what are the pros and cons to more of a &#8220;reverse periodization&#8221; if I were to do a lot of intensity and lower volume now, and then transition to more volume and less intensity basing this off racing 70.3s in 2021 sometime.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Thanks for the work you guys do and the detailed answers you always give!</div>
<div></div>
<h3>What the Coaches Say:</h3>
<ul>
<li>It absolutely does depend on a number of factors: age, past training, durability, etc.</li>
<li>Joel Friel&#8217;s 12-week base period is often helpful. Consists of polarized base 1, 2, and 3.</li>
<li>You could do 30 weeks of base if you wanted, but watch out for stagnation and plateau.</li>
<li>Begin with the least specific and as you approach your race the training gets more specific.</li>
<li>Look at this base period as HR based or power based. Don&#8217;t get wrapped up on pace.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t think about FTP during the base period.</li>
<li>If you say base phase training is your weakness, don&#8217;t put a time frame on it. You could easily do 8 weeks of base 1, another 8 of base 2, and another 8 of base 3.</li>
<li>For the swim, focus on kick and drills.</li>
<li>90/10 or 95/5 approach is ok. The main goal should be to increase volume, not intensity.</li>
<li>This is absolutely a time to work on strength training and functional fitness.</li>
<li>The world is your oyster right now! You can do no wrong.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Marty asks:</b></h2>
<h3><b>My weakness is my LT&#8211;how do I increase it?</b></h3>
<div>In response to your last show when Lucho talked about focusing on your weakness it got me to thinking that my weakness is my LT, it&#8217;s too low I think. I hit it at 150 HR according to tests and that&#8217;s pretty close to my MAF of 140. SHouldn&#8217;t my LT be closer to 160-165? I&#8217;ve been an endurance athlete for 8 years so I have been training regularly, mostly half-marathons and the occasional marathon. I also have a bike and ride regularly, but don&#8217;t do triathlon or race bikes.</div>
<div></div>
<div>What are your top 3- workouts and/or tips for improving LT? Both run and bike?</div>
<div>
<h3>What the Coaches Say:</h3>
<ul>
<li>There&#8217;s a possibility that your MAF is too high. Consider going more zone based.</li>
<li>Is your endurance up to snuff? In order to develop a strong LT, you need to have endurance.</li>
<li>What type of training have you been doing? If you&#8217;ve been doing a lot of intensity, step back and just do MAF for 6-8 weeks.</li>
<li>Maybe the test was an off day. What other variables are at play?</li>
<li>Assuming your MAF is correct and the LT test is correct, your LT is bad&#8230; as you know <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> LT should be more like 20-25 beats above MAF.</li>
<li>Threshold workouts for run and bike are similar, though bike is more durational.
<ul>
<li>You need to go into them rested and fueled (with carbs), then rest after them because they&#8217;re fatiguing.</li>
<li>Best bike: 2 x 20 minutes steady state LT (advanced!)
<ul>
<li>Start with: 2 x 10 FTP, 3 x 15, 3 x 20, then up to 2 x 20. 1 minute rest in between intervals, but take as long as you need to hit the target.</li>
<li>If you need an even more gradual entryway: 4 x 5 min.</li>
<li>&#8220;In n outs&#8221; for 20 minutes can also be helpful, as it engages your brain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can do the same for the run.</li>
<li>Mile repeats on the run at 10 seconds faster than LT pace is ok, but all-out sprints isn&#8217;t as helpful.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h2><b>Megan asks:</b></h2>
<h3><b>How to go about researching for a new coach?</b></h3>
<div>
<div>I am a long time listener and look forward to listening to your podcast every weekend during my long runs. Without knowing it; Tawnee &amp; Lucho have guided me through 2 Boston marathons and a handful of shorter races. These 2 experts are the best!</div>
<div>Question for the podcast:</div>
<div>I am reaching out to see if you could offer any guidance on finding a running coach?</div>
<div>I have been coached by someone locally and built a strong foundation in strength, durability and endurance with her, however, due to the pandemic she has had to close her one on one coaching business (so sad and tragic).</div>
<div>Although I don’t know if marathons will happen in the fall, I am registered for the Chicago marathon in 16 weeks.</div>
<div>I’ve built a solid aerobic base using your guidance and MAF method- building up to a 100 mile run week at one point and can easily run 60+ miles on any given week without much strain.</div>
<div>My marathon PR is a 3:10 at Boston and am really just looking to hold around that fitness, maybe shave off a few minutes if possible.</div>
<div>Searching now for a running coach just to help set up a training schedule that gives me adaptation without running my body into the ground.</div>
<div>Can you help?</div>
<div></div>
<div>Thank you again for all that you do!</div>
<div>PS: Lucho’s Instagram workouts are awesome!</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What the Coaches Say:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Start with the methodology. If you&#8217;re a fan of MAF, find someone who is already using MAF or is willing to incorporate it into their approach.
<ul>
<li>Of course, this is difficult. There&#8217;s no database of coaches and their philosophies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t settle for someone who says it&#8217;s &#8220;my way or the highway.&#8221; You want a coach who&#8217;s flexible and can adapt to your needs.</li>
<li>You clearly have a lot of motivation and the potential to push yourself over the edge. You need someone who can rein you in.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll want a coach who will monitor your recovery (whether that&#8217;s quantitative or qualitative is up to you).</li>
<li>You want a coach who will give you what you need: you don&#8217;t need a cheerleader. You want a legit guide.</li>
<li>Start stalking people on social media! This includes coaches and athletes. Put out feelers from there.</li>
<li>Ask local running clubs (online for now).</li>
<li>If there&#8217;s a big-time coach you like, see which coaches follow/engage with them on social media.</li>
<li>Before committing to a coach, see if you can do a 15-minute phone call or a short email exchange. You want to make sure it&#8217;s a good fit.</li>

<p><a href="https://www.carriecheadle.com">Carrie Cheadle</a> is a <a href="https://www.carriecheadle.com/coaching/">Certified Mental Performance Consultant</a> and author. She&#8217;s also been on Endurance Planet twice before, <a href="https://www.enduranceplanet.com/?s=carrie+cheadle">click here</a> for her past appearances. Her most recent book, <a href="https://amzn.to/3dNw192">Rebound</a>, is the topic of this episode and takes you through the mental training that complements healing from injury. And not just injury&#8211;the tools Carries presents transcend athletic injuries and are useful for anyone going through a tough time, including the abrupt and unexpected changes and cancellations we&#8217;re all facing in 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic. Grab your pen and paper or keep these show notes nearby because in this show, we dive into very specific topics presented in the book that set the stage for the tools you need to level up your mental game. Carrie is also host to the <a href="https://injuredathletesclub.com/podcast/">Injured Athletes Club podcast</a>, and has a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/TheInjuredAthletesClub/">Facebook support group for injured athletes</a>. We encourage you to pick up a copy of her new book, <a href="https://amzn.to/3dNw192">Rebound</a>.</p>
<p>This book, <a href="https://amzn.to/3dNw192">Rebound</a>, is not just helpful for injury. People are struggling for many reasons right now, and books like this can help. Injury parallels the covid19 pandemic cancellations and abrupt and unexpected changes to the 2020 season. Mainly, none of us are racing right now; we’ve had that taken away, so it’s a lot like being injured, and thus, the process to healing has parallels. From a mental perspective, we are all “injured athletes” in a sense right now… and it’s not easy!</p>
<p>On this episode:</p>
<p><strong>Injury/setback is just as much MENTAL as it is PHYSICAL</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dealing with all the unknowns that come with an injury/setback can be challenging, but it&#8217;s also a normal part of the journey to encounter setbacks!</li>
<li>How to continue to stay motivated through setbacks by deliberately adjusting your goal(s)</li>
<li>Possible correlation between high levels of stress and those who get injured more often
<ul>
<li>More research needs to be done to determine the cause and effect.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chronic stress can throw the HPA axis out of whack, making it more difficult for your parasympathetic nervous system to do its job of calming you down.</li>
<li>High levels of stress can affect:
<ul>
<li>Our immune system</li>
<li>Our brain, making it harder to make rational decisions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When we are under stress, sometimes self-care is one of the first things to go.</li>
<li>When injured, not racing, or in any position from which one needs to bounce back and recover— don’t ignore the mental component of the setback too.</li>
<li>During the recovery process, go F.A.R.
<ul>
<li>Feel &#8211; feel your feelings without guilt and label the specific emotion.</li>
<li>Accept &#8211; accept where you&#8217;re at right now.</li>
<li>Recover &#8211; your recovery is your sport!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>“Injury ranks among the most stressful events you will go through as an athlete; not only are both your body and your mind under duress, but you’re often denied the regular endorphin boost that comes with intense physical activity. Proactively seek out these feel-good neurochemicals aids in recovery by countering the stress you’re enduring.”
<ul>
<li>ACTION: <em>Make a list of alternative ways to boost endorphins, seek joy and support. </em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Getting (un)stuck</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you <em>want</em> something to be different, you have to <em>do</em> something different.</li>
<li>Progress is not a perfect, upward trajectory.</li>
<li>Seek external support.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Control</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Write down what is inside and outside of your control
<ul>
<li>What do you notice about the two sides? Which side do you feel like you have been living in?</li>
<li>Hardiness &#8211; personality construct made up of three different parts: control, challenge, and commitment</li>
<li>Encouraging a shift in focus on what you still can do</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Our thoughts like to time travel; when we feel out of control usually we have traveled too far forward (i.e., too wrapped up in the what-ifs).</li>
<li>STAY PRESENT or cultivate the ability to <em>bring yourself back to the present moment</em>
<ul>
<li>Meditation is a tool to help cultivate/develop mindfulness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Do things to help mitigate stress.</li>
<li>Double-down on things that bring your joy and relaxation.</li>
<li>Have things to look forward to, even something small!</li>
<li>Incorporate random reminders into your life:
<ul>
<li>Set an affirmation reminder on your phone for your future self!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We have a tendency to want to run away from our emotions, but so much can be gained by allowing yourself to feel your feelings.</li>
<li>Treat yourself like you would treat a cherished loved one.</li>
<li>Give yourself compassion, kindness, and grace.</li>

<h3><b>Study discussion:</b></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213231720300835" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213231720300835&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1592318180091000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG10zplUS5HTIfEKKZQrrOURhpeBQ">Intramuscular mechanisms of overtraining</a></li>
<li>Published Jan 2020</li>
<li>From the study: &#8220;the purpose of this review is to discuss potential underlying mechanisms that may contribute to exercise-induced overtraining syndrome (OTS) in skeletal muscle.&#8221;
<ul>
<li><b style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Prevalence</b>
<ul>
<li>Studies report that ~30% of both young athletes (&lt; 18 years) and elite athletes (&gt; 18 years old) have experienced overreaching/OTS at least once [6–9]. However a prevalence of as high as ~60% in male and female elite runners have been described [10].</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Defining OTS</b>
<ul>
<li>Persistent underperformance despite &gt; 2 months of recovery,</li>
<li>Changes in mood</li>
<li>Absence of symptoms/diagnosis of other possible causes of underperformance [8,9,11,12].</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">OTS has been attributed to both central (psychological, neurological) and peripheral (intramuscular) mechanisms [8,9,11,12]. </b>
<ul>
<li>The major proposed mechanisms underlying skeletal muscle weakness in OTS:
<ol>
<li><b style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Glycogen depletion hypothesis- </b><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">contributes but not enough to explain mechanism nor directly cause.</span></li>
<li><b style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Muscle damage hypothesis-</b><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> Mechanical damage not directly responsible for exercise-induced loss of force or OTS; not a direct cause.</span></li>
<li><b style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Inflammation hypothesis- </b><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Thus, repeated strenuous exercise can induce a persistent intramuscular molecular cytokine signature, which shares commonalities with disease states of chronic inflammation (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis [80]) which is accompanied by muscle weakness [76–78,80]. As a result, repeated strenuous physical activity with too short recovery periods that induces soluble factors which prolongs the duration of inflammation will most certainly lead to decreased muscle function and may well be a key component in OTS.</span></li>
<li><b style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">The oxidative stress hypothesis- </b><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Similar to chronic disease, OTS may represent a state of chronic oxidative stress. For instance, blood markers of oxidative stress (e.g. depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH)) can persist for longer than a month following an ultra-endurance running event [100].</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Conclusion: </b>&#8220;Current data implicates reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS) and inflammatory pathways as the most likely mechanisms contributing to OTS in skeletal muscle. Finally, we allude to potential interventions that can mitigate OTS in skeletal muscle.&#8221;</li>
<li><b style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Inflammation</b>
<ul>
<li>For instance, over-expression of IL-6 causing chronically elevated IL-6 levels in skeletal muscle, results in lowered force production, reduced expression of proteins in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, and diminished respiratory capacity [81].</li>
<li>Moreover, exercise-induced muscle damage can persist for weeks and trigger macrophage activation where several cytokines (incl. TNFα, IFNγ, IL-6, and IL-10), appear to be involved [44,50,63,64].</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">VICIOUS CYCLE: </b><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Cytokines are known to increase the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and in turn, ROS can promote release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [67,80,84–86]. (And process continues)</span>
<ul>
<li>ROS can cause an imbalance in the redox state of the muscle, resulting in impaired exercise performance as evident in athletes with OTS [12,87].</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">One solution to mitigate OTS:</b><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> use of antioxidants to alleviate the oxidative stress. “We acknowledge that antioxidants (e.g., vitamin C and E) given to healthy individuals can have detrimental effects on endurance training adaptations [94–96]. However, here we imply that OTS more closely resembles a state of chronically elevated oxidative stress, such as in chronic disease, rather than exercise adaptation.</span>
<ul>
<li>Antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds may show promise in neutralizing the elevated oxidative stress and chronic inflammation in muscles of athletes with OTS, although further research is required.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Of note: </b><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Many articles referenced were rat studies, and OTS is a HUMAN condition that is about more than muscle physiology.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Jessie asks:</h2>
<h3><b style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">The 30% rule for running and should we follow it</b></h3>
<p>This rule states that your weekend long run should be no more than 30% of your total weekly volume. How and why this is, where does it apply (eg triathlete vs runner), when should it be considered (eg running durability), etc.</p>
<h3>What the Coaches say:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Even though this percentage is a good general rule, it might not always be appropriate based on specific circumstances.</li>
<li>This rule is in place to protect you. But if you can safely break it, then do it. Be honest about your durability.</li>
<li>Triathletes especially can break this rule, because their time on the bike takes away from run volume. This rule would probably be unrealistic for most triathletes, though it would work better for pure runners.</li>
<li>What&#8217;s the effect of pushing that volume? If you do excessive volume on your long run, then have to take several days off to recover, then you need to shorten the long run.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Kenaia N. asks:</b></h2>
<h3><b>How to train with the goal of improvement when there are no races?</b></h3>
<p>Hi! I absolutely love your podcast and have a question I&#8217;m hoping you&#8217;ll be able to answer&#8230;</p>
<p>This is probably on a lot of people&#8217;s minds at the moment, but I&#8217;m curious what the smartest way to train right now is, when races are cancelled and it&#8217;s hard to know what to plan for.</p>
<p>My own dilemma is this: I was planning on racing Boston and New York this year as my spring and fall races. As things stand now, I&#8217;m planning on racing Boston in the fall and just giving New York my best after that. I&#8217;m training like these races are going to happen, building up to 80 mile weeks, incorporating speed work where it will be appropriate, etc. But my fear is that one or both will end up being cancelled.</p>
<p>I understand how to write a periodized training plan, but how do I train to improve if there are no races (specifically, when there are no marathons)? My end goal is to qualify for the Olympic Trials in the next 4 years (the qualifying time is 2:45 for women). If Boston and/or New York are cancelled, would it be smarter to just run steady base mileage until I can target a specific race? Should I create shorter-distance time trials for myself? Obviously this is a hypothetical as both races are still currently scheduled, but I&#8217;d love to know your thoughts on how to train for an end goal without the benchmarks races give us.</p>
<h3>What the Coaches say:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You&#8217;re tying training and improvement to racing, but that&#8217;s not necessary. You can gauge improvement by looking at training blocks.</li>
<li>For athletes who are trained for long distance, their weakness is normally speed.
<ul>
<li>Stepping back and doing a speed focus will not detract from your endurance. It will actually make you a stronger athlete to work on 1-mile and 5-mile speed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is limiting you from running 2:45? It&#8217;s not volume, but speed.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s no &#8220;right&#8221; training right now. &#8220;Appropriate training&#8221; is based on the assumption that you have a race X days out. Since there are no races, there&#8217;s no wrong way to train (as long as you don&#8217;t get hurt). Right now you&#8217;re just training to train.</li>
<li>Note to everyone right now: Do NOT train for your goal race, since we don&#8217;t know when they&#8217;re going to happen!</li>

<p>Welcome to episode 18 of Holistic Performance Nutrition (HPN) featuring <a href="http://coachtawnee.com/">Tawnee Gibson</a>, MS, CSCS, CISSN, and Julie McCloskey, a certified holistic nutrition coach who you can find over at <a href="http://wildandwell.fit/">wildandwell.fit</a>.</p>
<p>On this episode:</p>
<h2><strong>Seasonal Eating Guide &#8211; Summer:</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Raspberries</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Resistant starch source, along with other berries too!</li>
<li><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21329358/">Berry Polyphenols Inhibit α-Amylase in Vitro: Identifying Active Components in Rowanberry and Raspberry</a>
<ul>
<li>Evidence to show that raspberries inhibit amylase, the enzyme that we use to digest starch, leaving more for our good gut flora (i.e., acts as resistant starch).</li>
<li>Polyphenol-rich extracts from a range of berries inhibited α-amylase in vitro, but the most effective were from raspberry and rowanberry.</li>
<li>Such synergistic interactions could have implications for the current clinical use of acarbose for postprandial glycaemic control in type-2 diabetics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lower sugar than other fruits (50-75% less than things like apples and mango).</li>
<li>It has anthocyanins which may improve blood sugar.</li>
<li>Incorporate raspberries literally anywhere (e.g., spread raspberries right on your toast), but specifically, have with your higher carb foods and note if it helps your PP blood sugar response!</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Arugula</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>A peppery, nutty salad green with a bitter bite. Mass-produced Baby Arugula will be milder, “wild” arugula will have more of a kick.</li>
<li>Mostly grown in CA and AZ, but also found locally in many other places.</li>
<li>Arugula goes bad within a few days; the best way to store it is to keep them in a damp paper towel. Plastic bags create a moist environment that makes them mushy.</li>
<li>Use raw from basically anything: pizza, omelets, pasta, salads (pairs well with fatty and acidic ingredients), as a side to meat or fish, or chop them up for a pesto!</li>
<li>Health Benefits
<ul>
<li>Glucosinolates &#8211; sulfur-containing compounds, and key phytonutrients that are believed to act against cancer cells</li>
<li>High antioxidant food &#8211; Vitamins K, A, &amp; C</li>
<li>Liver &#8211; arugula contains cleansing properties that help counteract the poisoning effects of heavy metals particularly in your liver</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Figs</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Peak season mid to late summer.</li>
<li>In season, go for the fresh/raw figs, not the dried ones. Although dried figs are a powerhouse of nutrients, 100g of dried figs have more than 3x the carbs and sugar than 100g of fresh/raw figs.</li>
<li>High in fiber and potassium.</li>
<li>Throw in with a salad &#8211; pairs well with arugula, goat cheese, and walnuts; use to naturally sweeten your oatmeal; make homemade fig bars; sweeten your smoothie bowls or have with yogurt; eat them plain as a snack.</li>

<ul>
<li>Used in traditional Chinese medicine commonly as an aid in healthy immune function</li>
<li>Fruit, root, and leaves are used in native system of medicine for gastrointestinal disorders (colic, indigestion, loss of appetite and diarrhea), respiratory disorders (sore throats, coughs, and bronchial problems), inflammatory disorders and cardiovascular disorders (Ponelope 1997). Fig has been traditionally used for its medicinal benefits as metabolic, cardiovascular, respiratory, antispasmodic, and anti-inflammatory remedy (Duke et al., 2002).</li>
<li>This study showed that fig (isolated Ficus carica polysaccharide (FCP) from fig and turned into a liquid tincture) can help stimulate an immune system response in grass carp (fish) to ward of illness and bacterial invaders we don’t want (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25449378/">source</a>).</li>

<h3><strong>Parsley</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The season begins in late spring to early summer.</li>
<li>Curly leaf (French) is mild and slightly herbaceous. The flat-leaf (Italian) is more grassy and peppery.</li>
<li>Food safety recalls from salmonella contamination so grow your own or buy local and wash it!</li>
<li>Refrigerate in a plastic bag for up to a week, OR better yet, in a glass jar upright with a few inches of water.</li>
<li>Make tabbouleh &#8211; Middle Eastern salad made of bulgur wheat, tomatoes, and herbs. Or persillade (French) &#8211; Finely chopped parsley and garlic to add to roasted veggies, rice, pasta, or eggs.</li>
<li>Health benefits
<ul>
<li>½ cup is 50% of vitamin C</li>
<li>High in vitamins K and A</li>
<li>Considered the “motherlode of disease-fighting phytonutrients”</li>
<li>Flavonoids have shown promise to reduce inflammation and support our immune systems.</li>
<li>Antibacterial and antifungal properties.</li>
<li>Freshens up bad breath because of its antibacterial properties.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h3><strong>Garlic</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Prebiotic food
<ul>
<li>Defined as: “nondigestible food ingredients that beneficially affect the host by selectively stimulating the growth of one or a limited number of bacterial species in the colon, such as Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, which have the potential to improve host health.” (<a href="https://ilsi.eu/publication/concepts-of-functional-foods/">source</a>)</li>
<li>But the more you cook, the more you lose prebiotically</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Thousands of peer-reviewed studies looking at the health benefits of garlic.</li>
<li>Family with leeks, onion, chives, scallion.</li>
<li>Contains: flavonoids, oligosaccharides, amino acids, allicin, and sulfur.</li>
<li>If dealing with SIBO, sit this one out for a bit.</li>
<li>Raw is better than cooked for health purposes (i.e., used as an antimicrobial), but cooked garlic is still high in antioxidants and sulfur.
<ul>
<li>No antimicrobial properties from consuming cooked garlic, but still get the nutritional benefit of the sulfur compounds</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Allicin, an organosulfur compound, is a powerful antimicrobial/antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, antiparasitic. Pathogenic microbes don’t seem to be able to develop resistance to allicin over time,
<ul>
<li>HOWEVER- allicin doesn’t withstand cooking/heat (no more than 117F wet heat; 150F dry heat for allicin to stay alive), so consuming fresh, uncooked garlic should be crushed, sliced, or chewed to maximize allicin production.</li>
<li>If you’re not down for raw garlic- Allicin supplements are widely available.
<ul>
<li>I like Allimax or Allimax Pro by Allimax Neutraceuticals.</li>

<ul>
<li>90-day intervention: Garlic allicin supplement group had 60% fewer colds, 70% fewer days affected</li>
<li>One report describes that during an influenza epidemic, the former Soviet Union imported more than 500 tons of garlic cloves for acute treatment. Among the viruses sensitive to garlic extracts are the human cytomegalovirus, human rhinovirus type 2, herpes simplex types 1 and 2, and influenza B. Evidence points toward allicin and its condensation product ajoene as the main components in garlic responsible for this antiviral activity.</li>

<h2><strong>Jessica asks:</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Helping Gut After a Round of Antibiotics</strong></h3>
<p>I had to take antibiotics for a recent UTI and my gut’s been off since. I’m training for a marathon later this year and then a 50k, and I’m all-in with the holistic approach. In this case, I want to make sure I’m doing everything I can to keep my gut health as good as it can be so if I had to take antibiotics, what can or should I do now to help rebuild anything I may have lost?</p>
<h3>What the Coaches say:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Antibiotics have their time and place.</li>
<li>The coaches are not against antibiotics. If you need to go on a round on antibiotics, then please do so.</li>
<li>Why can antibiotics be harmful to us?
<ul>
<li>Overprescribed</li>
<li>It’s very hard to take an antibiotic without affecting other bacteria as well; antibiotics kill both the bad and good bacteria</li>
<li>So while the objective of the antibiotic is to get rid of the pathogenic bacteria, it will kill other harmless gut bacteria, even the antibiotics that have a more specific mission</li>
<li>Due to the rapid reduction of bacteria in your gut, it allows for other diseases and opportunistic (i.e., possible candida) bacteria to come in and take over. You end up with less diversity which can lead to a deregulation of the immune system, inflammation in the gut, and may also lead to autoimmune diseases</li>
<li>Wide spectrum antibiotics cause even more harm, as they tend to eliminate a huge chunk of the gut bacterial community</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When taking antibiotics
<ul>
<li>Avoid foods that feed yeast and hard to digest/potentially inflammatory foods
<ul>
<li>Sugar, gluten, dairy, soy, alcohol</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Eat probiotic-rich foods
<ul>
<li>Sauerkraut, kimchi, low sugar kombucha, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Eat prebiotics!
<ul>
<li>Feed beneficial flora</li>
<li>Garlic, leeks, onions, jicama, chicory root, asparagus, green bananas and plantains, cacao, resistant starches (cooled potatoes/rice)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Antibiotics and training
<ul>
<li>Consider MAF-based approach without too much intensity; intensity may add insult to injury</li>
<li>Consider skipping races or big events while taking antibiotics</li>
<li>Think of all the things that contribute to leaky gut, or your GI triggers, and avoid those if needing to take antibiotics</li>
<li>Do more yoga and restorative activity instead</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0095476">Short-Term Effect of Antibiotics on Human Gut Microbiota</a>
<ul>
<li>“These studies have shown that treatment is followed by a significant alteration of the gut microbiota composition and a <strong>decrease between one-fourth to one-third of the microbial diversity i</strong>n the digestive tract <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0095476#pone.0095476-Dethlefsen1">[4]</a>, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0095476#pone.0095476-Jernberg1">[8]</a>. The microbiota is relatively resilient and <strong>returns to the pre-treatment state several weeks </strong>after drug cessation <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0095476#pone.0095476-DeLaCochetiere1">[9]</a>.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;However, other recent studies on the long-term effects of antibiotic intake have shown that <strong>microbiota does not show complete resilience three months after treatment cessation</strong> <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0095476#pone.0095476-Dethlefsen1">[4]</a>, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0095476#pone.0095476-Jakobsson1">[5]</a>, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0095476#pone.0095476-DeLaCochetiere1">[9]</a>, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0095476#pone.0095476-Manichanh1">[10]</a>, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0095476#pone.0095476-Willing1">[11]</a>. Variations in the resilience observed might be due to differences in the methodology used to analyze microbiota variability.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2844414/">Short-Term Antibiotic Treatment Has Differing Long-Term Impacts on the Human Throat and Gut Microbiome</a>
<ul>
<li>“Although the diversity of the microbiota subsequently recovered to resemble the pre-treatment states, <strong>the microbiota remained perturbed in some cases for up to four years post treatment.</strong> In addition, four years after treatment high levels of the macrolide resistance gene <em>erm</em>(B) were found, indicating that <strong>antibiotic resistance, once selected for, can persist for longer periods of time than previously recognized. </strong>This highlights the importance of a restrictive antibiotic usage in order to prevent subsequent treatment failure and potential spread of antibiotic resistance.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h2><b>Suzanne S. asks:</b></h2>
<h3><b>How to build a smart weekly schedule?</b></h3>
<div>
<p>Hey guys!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a long time listener and really value the advice you two hand out.  You keep me company early on Saturday mornings!  I liked your May 8th podcast which discussed training for life vs a race and it sparked a question.  I&#8217;m guessing that I might be overthinking, the way I often do, but here it is anyways:</p>
<p>Brief history: I&#8217;m a 39 yr old female who loves exercise and getting outdoors first thing in the morning.  I used to run half marathons (middle of the pack, trained with a running group) but I burnt myself out 5 years ago due to too much exercise and work and stress and not enough rest and relaxation.  I started following the MAF approach and have learned a lot about listening to my body.  I also have never really gotten to the point that I can do anything more than a shuffle at MAF.  My routine for a few years has been a 45 minute shuffle/walk (5ish times/week) around the flattest streets that I can find in my neighborhood.  It gives me a dose of fresh air but otherwise it feels lame (because it&#8217;s neither a walk nor a run) and I end up not having time in my day for other exercise.</p>
<p>I should mention that my goals are to be healthy, strong and well-rounded and be able to comfortably go for an easy run with a friend once in a while.  I&#8217;m not interested in training for a race or running long distances.  I also have to be careful about stress and not letting myself overdo it in terms of exercise.</p>
<p>During this weird covid time, I&#8217;ve switched things up a bit and have been going on some shorter non-MAF runs (25-30 min, heart rate around 160 at an easy pace &#8211; feels good as long as I keep it short), lots of walks and doing more strength work (body weight exercises, TRX and some weights at home, nothing crazy heavy).  I get a nice little boost of energy from these workouts.  I like the variety and although I have this bad feeling psychologically about letting my heart rate go up, I am having way more fun!  <b><b>My question is as to how to schedule things: </b></b>I&#8217;ve heard of the idea of making hard days hard and easy days easy.  Would it make more sense to do strength work on the same days as my short runs and then have a few days/week where I stick to things like walking and yoga?  Or is it ok to do a little bit of hard work every day as long as it&#8217;s for a short time &#8211; say a 25 min run followed by a 20 min walk a few days/week and a 25 min strength session on the alternating days with one rest day/week&#8230;</p>
<p>Again, maybe I&#8217;m overthinking but would love to hear what you have to say. Thanks again for all you do and take care during these crazy times!</p>
<h3 dir="auto">What the Coaches say:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Burnout is descriptive of a mental condition, not a physical one. Lucho doesn&#8217;t see any indication of physical overtraining in your language.</li>
<li>Your efforts to mitigate stress are actually causing you more stress!</li>
<li>Put your HR monitor away for a month. Allow yourself to have guilt-free freedom of choice to exercise the way you like. Be honest with yourself about perceived exertion, and do what feels good physically and mentally.</li>
<li>With no races planned, there is no correct training.</li>
<li>Your training at 160 bpm is almost certainly still aerobic.</li>
<li>Take a more playful approach to your training. Try to release some of your rigidity.</li>
<li>The intensity of your runs doesn&#8217;t seem particularly difficult for you. Plus, the 25 min strength workouts also don&#8217;t seem too strenuous. Feel free to experiment. Try a week of running 5 days with 2 of those runs at 160 bpm and strength/walks as you see fit. See how you feel.</li>
<li>When work is stressful, don&#8217;t add the extra stress of a hard workout.</li>

<h2><strong>Alyssa asks:</strong></h2>
<h3><b>MAF feels too hard, body feeling run down</b></h3>
<div>
<div dir="auto">Hi Endurance Planet Team!</div>
<div dir="auto"></div>
<div dir="auto">I’m a new listener and am so glad I found the podcast! I’ve been listening pretty religiously and super grateful for all the information you put out!</div>
<div dir="auto"></div>
<div dir="auto">I learned about MAF through the show and have started trying to incorporate it in my runs but have found that my comfortable running pace has kept my heart rate well under my MAF goal. I’m wondering if this might be a strength or muscle power issue? Would you recommend running fast enough to reach my MAF range even if it means I will burn out and need to run shorter distances?</div>
<div dir="auto"></div>
<div dir="auto">For some context, I just got back into running over the past two months while the stay at home order has been in place. I mountaineer/alpine ski and have a strong aerobic base and lots of weekly miles in my training already, although very little of them while running. I also currently (and historically) incorporate low intensity strength training in my routine 4-5 times per week, focusing mainly on physical therapy style workouts and usually 2 sessions a week focusing solely on legs. I’ve had a meniscus tear, BAD ankle sprain, and Achilles injury within the past six years but over the past two years have stayed injury free by really dialing in mobility and strength training especially for my legs.</div>
<div dir="auto"></div>
<div dir="auto">I’m 28 and per the standard MAF formula (180-28) my target is 142-152. To get myself up to the 150-152 range I need to be running up a steep hill for a few minutes or running close to a sprint and there’s no way right now I’m strong enough to keep that pace for a run. For example, I did a 13 mile run yesterday on mostly flat trail and road (~1000’ gain total) and my heart rate pretty much stayed around 130-132 bpm the entire time. Even when I do shorter 5 mile runs, for example, my natural pace keeps my heart rate at about 130 bpm.</div>
<div dir="auto"></div>
<div dir="auto">I think I could definitely push myself to run faster and get my HR closer to my MAF range but would have to cut back on my weekly volume. I’m running between 20-25 miles per week right and would like to slowly increase that base (I’ve been adding ~1-2 miles per week). I don’t have any races in mind but I’ve been loving trail running so much and would be stoked to one day incorporate it into my mountaineering goals. Being able to run and climb some mountains light and fast vs. hauling a bunch of over night gear for a climb is an exciting prospect to me. And just running at higher altitudes and more remote places in the wilderness is a super exciting prospect for me too. So frankly, I really don’t care about going fast I care about going far and having the endurance to get a lot of miles and elevation gain in. And my primary goal is also metabolic health and remaining injury free.</div>
<div dir="auto"></div>
<div dir="auto">Just curious how you think I should be using the MAF method in my weekly training given my goals and where my comfortable pace is keeping my HR at?</div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div dir="auto">My pace on flatish road at my MAF HR is ~8:15-8:30 min/miles. My pace at ~132 HR is ~10:00 min/miles. I have only done one MAF test on a rolling/mildly hilly trail with the following times per mile:</div>
<div dir="auto"></div>
<div dir="auto">1. 8:16</div>
<div dir="auto">2. 8:28</div>
<div dir="auto">3. 8:21</div>
<div dir="auto">4. 8:35</div>
<div dir="auto">5. 8:47</div>
<div dir="auto"></div>
<div dir="auto">I’m also wondering if I can add another question? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I’m wondering what your opinion is on if it’s possible for me to continue running at MAF (or even just my perceived easy pace closer to 10 min/miles) while trying to balance out my hormones?</div>
<div></div>
<div dir="auto">I recently got bloodwork and had high SBGH, testosterone, and estrone. My estrogen was in the normal range. I sadly didn’t get my cortisol tested but I just know it’s high. I struggle with waking up in the middle of the night between 1-3 AM with a stressed and sometimes ravenous feeling. This is especially common after long weekends spent climbing/mountaineering. I’m grateful my job, relationships, and daily life are not stressful to me but I’m very type A and have always struggled with letting myself relax so I tend to operate in a more tense state anyways throughout the day to try to get as much done as possible even when I don’t need to. So I’m thinking I need to find a better balance with how I operate daily and how I handle my training to lower my cortisol and get my other hormones in check. I feel super good about my diet but do just feel like my body is out of whack for the past several years. I don’t really have extended periods of rest because I’m able to climb, ski, etc year round. I do try to get one-two rest days per week but I usually still do core and mobility work :/ I know I need to find a better balance I’m just trying to figure out how much to pare back and if I might need to take a break from any form of cardio altogether for awhile to let my hormones rebalance? Or if low intensity biking, running, hiking, and rock climbing could be okay for me and maybe take a month or so off from more intense forms of cardio like hiking/climbing with a heavy pack on all day and see if that helps?</div>
</div>
<h3 dir="auto">What the Coaches say:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lucho thinks the MAF formula is wrong for you. What&#8217;s the highest HR number you&#8217;ve ever seen? That&#8217;s indicative, a little bit, of where your natural HR capacity is.</li>
<li>125-135 seems to be where you should be training.</li>
<li>Struggling at your MAF HR is probably indicative of your overall state of health.</li>
<li>If hormones are out of whack, you might consider looking into symptoms of PCOS.</li>
<li>Do some at-home blood glucose testing. See if your fasting is above 90 (not ideal) or 100 (problematic) and postparandial levels are higher than 140 after an hour.

<h3 class="p2"><b>Melatonin</b></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li>The main reason someone is unable to sleep well is due to high-stress hormones
<ul class="ul1">
<li>The Soc Doc usually sees individuals making enough melatonin; however, individuals think they need more to suppress a skewed cortisol pathway</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Melatonin was added to the formula</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Melatonin can make you feel better, but you may not be addressing the actual problem</li>
<li class="li2">By supplementing with melatonin can we prevent our body&#8217;s ability to make it on its own?</li>
<li>How much is too much melatonin?</li>
<li>How the dietary aspect plays an important role</li>
<li class="li2">Brain-adrenal balance (HPA axis), hormones, and neurotransmitters:
<ul class="ul1">
<li>Melatonin is inversely proportional to cortisol (i.e., high cortisol at night is not good for melatonin)</li>
<li class="li2">Sex hormone imbalances; neuroendocrine influencers that can result in sleep disturbances.</li>
<li class="li2">Cortisol patterns</li>
<li class="li2">All these things measured on the <a href="https://dutchtest.com/shop/">DUTCH Test</a></li>
<li class="li2">How do our natural neurotransmitters affect melatonin and sleep?
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">GABA &#8211; the main inhibitory neurotransmitter, sleep promoter, decrease the activity of our wakefulness promoters (histamine, serotonin, norepinephrine)</li>
<li>Serotonin &#8211; too little not good, too much not good; serotonin makes melatonin; diet can play a role</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re suffering from sleep issues, please consult with a health practitioner.</li>

</ul>
<h3 class="p2"><b>CBD for athletes</b></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">It doesn&#8217;t cure anything; it might help reduce certain symptoms, but it does not correct the real issue.</li>
<li class="li2">Good CBD will have ~.3% of active THC in it; you might not pass a drug test</li>
<li class="li2">What is the reason you want to take CBD?</li>
<li class="li2">Purported benefits?
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Yes, for certain populations (e.g., people with seizures).</li>

<h2 class="p2"><b>Carolyn asks:</b></h2>
<h3 class="p2"><b>Hypermobile athletes and shoe choices, strength training, etc.</b></h3>
<p class="p2">I’m a 29 year old woman, been doing endurance sports for around 10 years now. Mainly cycling, however I’ve thrown in some triathlons and a few half marathons through the years. (PB half is 2:23 and would love to lower this). Prior to all this, I was a competitive luge athlete for 9 years which was mainly a power and explosive speed based sport. Big change in training but still love my time in the weight room as a result. For 2020, I have set myself the goal of doing my first half Ironman. My question revolves around running economy and efficiency as an athlete with some ligamentous laxity and hypermobility. I have always considered myself flexible but never considered it as a problem. However, I recently developed peroneal tendinitis and have been in physical therapy. This is my first running injury in many years. My PT commented on the hypermobility of my lower legs and feet in particular. I have double the normal range of motion in dorsiflexion (30 instead of 15-20 degrees), hyperextend my knees and have hypermobility in my first rays (big toes) and flexible flat feet.</p>
<p class="p2">I have transitioned to zero drop shoes for running through the years as they irritate my knees less than traditional shoes. Altras have been my preference due to the wide toe box. On a completely separate tangent, not loving the most recent iterations of their shoes. But that’s for a different day. Now my PT is recommending I switch to a more traditional running shoe with some stability to offset my hypermobility. As I’ve thought more about the biomechanics of it, it seems to make some sense. It also got me wondering, would that potentially make me more economical when running as it takes away from my full range of motion? (In my case, not a horrible thing). I know Lucho always stresses stiffness in the lower legs as being good for running economy and wondered if this would help. If not, any tips on strength training exercises to increase running economy? Always looking to get faster and would love your input.</p>
<h3 class="p1">What The Soc Doc says:</h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li>Estrogen’s effect on ligaments in women
<ul class="ul1">
<li>Estrogen levels too high, progesterone levels too low</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>PMS is common in females, but it is not normal</li>
<li class="li2">Loose ligaments and connective tissue disorders
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Ehlers Danlos syndrome</li>

<li>We, as individuals, can create change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Seasonal allergies:
<ul>
<li>If you have seasonal allergies, it means your health is impaired on some level. Because of that impairment, you&#8217;re not going to burn as much fat at the higher heart rate you wish you could maintain in training; therefore, you have to train at a lower heart rate to maintain a higher level of fat burning.</li>

<li>If you get more than two colds, infections, or bouts of flu per year, that is too many.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Steps to improve your gut health:
<ul>
<li>Get rid of junk food and sugar.</li>
<li>If you still have problems after removing junk food and sugar, you may have to eliminate certain foods.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re still having issues, you may want to take a test (e.g., stool test).</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re still having issues, you may need to see a Gastroenterologist.</li>
<li>It will take time to heal your gut.</li>
<li>Supplements; keep it simple!</li>

<p>Welcome to episode 17 of Holistic Performance Nutrition (HPN) featuring <a href="http://coachtawnee.com/">Tawnee Gibson</a>, MS, CSCS, CISSN, and Julie McCloskey, a certified holistic nutrition coach who you can find over at <a href="http://wildandwell.fit/">wildandwell.fit</a>.</p>
<p>On this episode:</p>
<h2>Intro:</h2>
<p>Julie is using this book: <a href="https://amzn.to/2Z6bWpZ">Training for the Uphill Athlete</a> for her 50k training plan.</p>
<h2 class="p1"><b>Sarah asks:</b></h2>
<h3 class="p1"><b>Managing caloric intake</b></h3>
<p class="p1">Hey all, I have a question about caloric intake during ultra training &#8211; I started running 50ks in 2017, and never really went with a meal plan or was even well informed about my caloric needs; I actually did my first 50k race after 28 days of strict keto, didn’t eat anything during the race and had one of my best performances to date. I’m now in the midst of training for my second 50 miler and my first 100k this spring, and have started to pay closer attention to overall energy balance &#8211; mainly for performance reasons and not due to any negative hormonal symptoms. Throughout this entire process (even the keto, which continued for another year and a half) I never lost my cycle (though its been harder to track with an IUD). With 50+ mile weeks, daily caloric needs break 3700kcal, which can be really really difficult to get (I’m a 27 year old female, 5’10”, 17% body fat, 60kg of lean mass).</p>
<p class="p1">My question is this: if your only two options are low-quality foods or no food, do you eat lower quality foods to get your daily calories? Obviously all high quality calories are ideal, but if that’s not an option is it better to eat a cookie or two to get the calories or skip things like processed flour, sugar, or simple carbs and finish the day in a deficit. I would consider high quality to be unprocessed, natural foods without added sugar. Thanks!</p>
<h3 class="p1">What the coaches say:</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Article &#8211; <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-04/tuom-usf041720.php"><span class="s2">UM study finds diverse diet as effective as sports supplements for female athletes</span></a></span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p2"><span class="s2"><a href="https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s00421-020-04352-2?shared_access_token=rUttgaB8UBfDYF2eHUf-O_e4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY6AMGFA4r1PClChjHKUq5ic_i7gefk9ctLaBGkGRElnZj6ZJIiew6NumF9_2VOsvQ0mHg10c9I2Ek8i87w-E6trtLY7Snn3mxJhaqEuM_zmLg%3D%3D">Study &#8211; Males and Females exhibit similar muscle glycogen recovery with varied food sources</a></span>
<ul>
<li class="p1">8 males and 8 females</li>
<li class="p1">90-minute glycogen depleted cycle</li>
<li class="p1">2 carbohydrate feedings afterward with either the sports supplements or potato-based product</li>
<li class="p1">Muscle biopsies (glycogen) and blood samples (glucose, insulin) were taken during recovery</li>
<li class="p1">Conclusion: &#8220;These results indicate that food items, such as potato-based products, can be as effective as commercially marketed sports supplements when developing glycogen recovery oriented menus and that absolute carbohydrate dose feedings (g kg−1) can be effectively applied to both males and females.&#8221;</li>
<li class="p1">Summary: The researchers found no difference in the efficacy between Gatorade and Mcdonald&#8217;s hashbrowns at recovering glycogen stores. Both products were low quality, but there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a difference between the liquids and solids, and that the more obsessed we get with finding the optimal option, the less likely we are to recover properly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="p1">Since you’re eating really well most of the time and are struggling to meet your energy needs, eat the cookies. Our bodies are resilient and will know what to do with the contents of the cookies and put it to good use.</li>
<li class="p1">A more light-hearted approach to refueling can be incredibly beneficial as the stress is low, and you’re more likely to meet your needs because you’re not “waiting to make something healthier” a couple of hours later when you get home.</li>
<li class="p1">Meal quality doesn&#8217;t have to be perfect! Meeting your caloric need is more important.</li>
<li class="p1">In the middle of nowhere and stuck without food? Find a gas station and look for hardboiled eggs, fruit, cookies.</li>
<li class="p1">Ditch the keto! There is no need to be doing keto, especially during your in-season.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="p1"><b>Marco asks:</b></h2>
<h3 class="p1"><b>Questioning ongoing LCHF vs periodizing carbs</b></h3>
<p class="p1">Hi. Marco, 32 yo from Belgium. I’ve been a MAF and LCHF enthusiast for many years. I&#8217;m even Primal Health Coach certified. I&#8217;m also an avid marathoner (PB of 3h05 and currently training to BQ). However, I&#8217;ve been questioning the LCHF approach for a while. Let me explain.</p>
<p class="p1">During my last training cycle (end of 2019), I was training 4-5x a week (about 50 km/week), including a weekly long run and another hard workout on the week (threshold or HIIT). The rest was aerobic training. I was eating LCHF pretty much all the time. However I often had lingering soreness and fatigue, especially the days after hard workouts. My body weight was around 68-69 kg but by the end of the training cycle it was lowering to 65-66 kg (which may or may not be a good thing). However, at the end of the training cycle I tried <a href="https://www.generationucan.com/discount/ep50"><span class="s4">UCAN</span></a> products after hard workouts and I noticed that I was recovering faster (no soreness the days after and I was feeling more energized).</p>
<p class="p1">Right now, during my current training cycle, I&#8217;m still paying attention to avoiding refined carbs and junk food but I&#8217;m more indulgent on carbs (refined or not) than before. My training volume is higher, I train 6x/week for a weekly volume of about 80 km. I usually have 3 hard workouts a week (1 long run, 1 HIIT session and 1 threshold workout), the rest being aerobic training. The training  load is the highest I&#8217;ve ever had and I&#8217;m making great progress towards my goal of BQ. My MAF tests have been improving a lot  (from 4:35/km to 4:15/km) as well as other markers. My body weight is remaining around 68-69 kg, which is higher than during my previous training cycles where I was progressively lowering to 65-66kg. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s because of an increase in muscle mass or not, but I&#8217;m in the best shape of my life. No lingering soreness or fatigue after hard workouts. I don’t consume UCAN but I’m sure to eat enough proteins after these workouts and consume carbs when I feel the need to (not always natural ones though). Thus my approach wrt the diet is more one of a periodized carbs that pure LCHF.</p>
<p class="p1">Last week I decided not to eat any refined carbs or grains, so I was back to a LCHF diet. My hard workouts were harder (increased RPE) and for the first time during this training cycle I had lingering soreness and fatigue the following days. Yesterday I ate a big pizza and I feel that my body just absorbed it all. I was just really hungry. Even though I have a hard time to admit it, my feeling is that a periodized or more indulgent approach to carb eating is the way to go. I’d like to add that I’m quite fat adapted (I’ve run a full marathon fasted in my MAF zone without any problem). What do you think about it?</p>
<h3 class="p1">What the coaches say:</h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">Find a more balanced approach &#8211; a way of eating that doesn’t lead you to eat a big pizza because you were so hungry from restricting all week.</li>
<li class="li1">Using the carbs around your workouts to fuel and recover properly</li>
<li class="li1">One of the great debates in sports nutrition these days: more traditional carb fueling that is well supported in the research? Or a more innovative LCHF approach that is just emerging?</li>
<li class="li1">There are many studies we could site arguing one way or another, but from what Tawnee has learned over the years that it comes down to this:
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">Develop your metabolic efficiency (aka “metabolic machinery”), so you’re not overly carb/sugar dependent, your blood sugar rocks, and you can use fat for fuel.
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">This process could come in many forms from temporary LCHF diets or keto in offseason to carb timing in season.</li>
<li class="li1">Keep in mind as an athlete, the winner is not determined who is burning the most fat for fuel! We still need to properly fuel for performance (and recovery, etc.), as you&#8217;ve seen with using <span class="s4"><a href="https://www.generationucan.com/discount/ep50">UCAN</a>,</span> for example.</li>
<li class="li1">Once the metabolic function is healthy, you don’t have to keep restricting carbs or stay keto, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li1">You’re already improving fat utilization just by training.
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s5"><a href="https://www.scienceofultra.com/blog/lowcarbtraining"><span class="s6">Exercise training is a stronger stimulus. Even in a fully fat-adapted athlete, who has adapted to a radical dietary manipulation comprising very high fat and very low carbohydrate, the increase in fat use during exercise is not extraordinary…perhaps as much as accomplished through training alone</span></a></span><span class="s1">.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li1">Don’t restrict a whole macro group from your diet and stay that way. Ever.</li>
<li class="li1">Energy &amp; carbohydrate needs are relative.
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">One big mistake is athletes not knowing their energy needs relative to training. You’re burning through more than the average human. Eat like it.</li>
<li class="li1">If you’re training a lot as most endurance athletes are, you’re still “low carb” at 100-250g day. The more your training goes up, the more carbs/calories you need and this will not necessarily hinder your fat adaptation and health markers.
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">Ex) sedentary person needing 2000 kcal/day as 30% CHO, 20% PRO, 50% fat &#8211; 150 grams CHO/day. But take an athlete needing 3500 kcal/day still only taking in 30% CHO, and that boosts to about 260g CHO a day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li1">Too many fasted workouts will mess up your health. Don’t be afraid to eat!</li>
<li class="li1">But to be sure&#8211;test test test!
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">Quarterly or bi-annual complete blood tests, blood glucose tests at home, <a href="https://dutchtest.com/shop/">hormone/adrenal tests (DUTCH)</a>, gut tests as needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li1">You are an individual.
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">What diet works for you is the one that keeps you healthy and performing well. Don’t force a diet that doesn’t feel good. And also, be open-minded that your dietary needs will change, and you have to evolve with it and not get too stuck in one way. There is no one correct way.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="p1"><b>Corey asks:</b></h2>
<h3 class="p1"><b>Runner’s diarrhea &#8211; is it the coffee?</b></h3>
<p class="p1">Hello. Recently started listening during quarantine. I&#8217;ve been getting most of my miles on the local streets and developed a new bad habit: I often need to loop around back home for the bathroom. I dont want to take imodium since my runs are local, and rather save them for races and long runs. My coffee ranges from hours before to close to heading out. Havent found any timing that fixes this problem. Is there something else to try?</p>
<h3 class="p1">What the coaches say:</h3>
<p class="p1">Things to consider:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">Coffee can stimulate colonic motor activity (in around 29% of people); it has naturally occurring chemicals that may stimulate muscle contractions in the lower colon, promoting bowel movements as quickly as 4 minutes later.</li>
<li class="li1">Acute or chronic diarrhea issue?
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">Do you have diarrhea outside of your runs?</li>
<li>A study on runner&#8217;s diarrhea says: “It is unlikely that individuals running at low intensity or for short durations will present with diarrhea.” Unless you’re running hard all the time (e.g., tempo or higher, but not MAF), it could be a gut issue being triggered by runs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li1">Diet
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s5"><a href="https://www.enduranceplanet.com/hpn4/"><span class="s6">If LCHF/keto diet, we discussed diarrhea on HPN 4</span></a></span><span class="s1"> </span></li>
<li class="li1">What’s your general diet like? Inflammatory foods, macros, restrictions, high sugar, refined junk, etc.?</li>
<li class="li1">What are you eating &amp; drinking the night before and morning pre-run?</li>
<li class="li1">What’s in your coffee, how much, etc?</li>
<li class="li1">Skip FODMAPs pre-run</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li1">The intensity of runs.
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">Usually higher intensity causes bigger problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="s1">Study: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27798441"><span class="s2"><b>Runner&#8217;s diarrhea: what is it, what causes it, and how can it be prevented?</b></span></a><b> </b></span>
<ul class="ul1">
<li>The main causes of diarrhea in runners are:
<ul class="ul1">
<li>Ischemic
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">“Blood is shunted from viscera to active tissues, such as skeletal muscles, the heart, lungs, and the brain [23,24], which leads to a decrease of approximately 80% of splanchnic blood flow, at 70% of VO2max [24].”</li>
<li class="li1">Both gastrointestinal ischemia and reperfusion cause mucosal injury, which leads to gut barrier function loss, increasing permeability and bacterial translocation [27], and resulting in the generation of endotoxins [11] that can cause diarrhea [1,5], though this is controversial [4,12&amp; ,28,29].</li>
<li class="li1">Although endotoxemia seems to be an important cause of diarrhea, more studies are necessary to evaluate the effect of bacterial translocation as a causal factor in runner’s diarrhea.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li1">Mechanical
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">More likely during a run vs. swimming/cycling?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li1">Nutritional factors
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">Pre: FODMAPs? Gluten? Hydration state</li>
<li class="li1">During: CHO ingestion, types of CHO, amount, osmolality, gel vs. liquid.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>KEY POINT: For the prevention of diarrhea, it has been recommended to avoid:
<ul class="ul1">
<li>Dehydration, pre-run ingestion of high-fiber, highly concentrated carbohydrate beverages (hyperosmolar), FODMAPs, caffeine, bicarbonate (baking soda), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li1">Gut dysbiosis
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">Issues outside of running?</li>
<li class="li1">Stress: GI problems highly prevalent in runners, high-intensity training, those under high general life stress, etc.</li>
<li class="li1">Gut permeability/leaky gut</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li1">Healing!
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">L-glutamine has some promising evidence though not conclusive.</li>
<li class="li1">Start more general with supplements: <a href="https://amzn.to/3cFrx3x"><span class="s4">GI Revive</span></a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/350AGkx"><span class="s4">Restore for Gut Health</span></a>, probiotics with lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains (food sources of probiotics too!), <span class="s3"><a href="https://amzn.to/350AGkx"><span class="s8">Restore</span></a></span>: a soil-derived mineral supplement to strengthen gut wall; promotes good bacteria.</li>
<li class="li1">Anti-inflammatory foods</li>
<li class="li1">Limit refined carbs (white flour, etc), sugars</li>
<li class="li1">No NSAIDs</li>
<li class="li1">Ongoing Imodium use is a bad idea.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="s2">Podcast mentioned: <a href="https://www.enduranceplanet.com/dana-lis-phd-new-research-on-gluten-free-and-low-fodmap-diets-for-athletes-and-takeaways-for-your-needs/"><i>Dana Lis PhD: New Research on Gluten-Free and Low-FODMAP Diets For Athletes, and Takeaways For Your Needs</i></a></span>
<ul class="ul1">
<li>A low-FODMAP diet improved a male athlete&#8217;s GI symptoms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li1">Bottom line: What you eat, how you exercise, how you’re recovering, it all matters. Poor diet, even outside of when you run, is not helping gut, gut barrier function, etc.</li>

<h3>Results from Tawnee&#8217;s HR Experiment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tawnee had her athletes go one week running at perceived MAF, but with HR not visible on their watches (though it was recorded). She discovered that most of her athletes ran at a faster pace with a lower HR when they <em>could not see their HR</em>! Why? We often get wrapped up in sticking to MAF and that extra stress causes an increased HR.</li>
<li>Give an intuitive MAF week a try and see how it works for you!</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>Training &#8216;For Life&#8217; vs. a Race</b></h3>
<div>
<p>Hi guys,  I have been a listener for about a year now and I love the show!  Thank you so much for your down to earth advice.  My question is: what are your recommendations for training (specifically running) when we are just looking for long-term health and improvement across the board vs. training for a race on the calendar?  Especially for people who are looking to do some strength training as well?  I feel like this is applicable when COVID-19 has forced a lot of those races to be cancelled.</p>
<div>
<div>Will I continue to see running improvement sticking to MAF runs 3x/week ~45-60 min/day with a longer run on weekends (so 4 runs/week total), or will there eventually be a plateau and no further improvement? If I do mix in &#8220;fun-runs&#8221; (tempo, fartlek, etc) will that hurt potential running improvement?</div>
<div></div>
<div>My current plan is: Monday &#8211; strength training (ST), tuesday &#8211; run, Wednesday &#8211; run, Thursday &#8211; ST, Friday &#8211; run, Saturday/Sunday &#8211; long run/rest in some order depending on schedule.</div>
<div></div>
<div>ST (3-5 reps x 5 sets @ 70-90% of 1RM) = squat, deadlift, bench, pull-ups</div>
<div>T/W/F Run = ~45-60 min @ MAF</div>
<div>Sat/Sun Run = 60+ min low end of MAF</div>
<div></div>
<div>Goal = would like to improve on everything, but improving run &gt; ST.</div>
<div></div>
<div>MAF = 151 bpm, ~9:15 pace</div>
<div>
<div></div>
<div>I am a 29 year old Male, 180 -190 lbs during year, former high school athlete, dropped off a little bit in college, and got back into working out after college.  Last few years, I have done  a mix of strength training, CrossFit, and endurance (have done a few half marathons and competed in my first sprint triathlon last year).  I have found that I prefer the peace that comes with running above anything else.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Thank you for continuing to put on a great show!</div>
<div></div>
<div>Cody from Nebraska</div>

</div>
<h3>What the Coaches say:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lucho would worry about plateauing more in strength than running.</li>
<li>Do this for 4-6 weeks and see if your average MAF pace improves. If not, then you&#8217;ll need to reassess the program.</li>
<li>Tawnee recommends changing your Wednesday run to include some intensity and consider doing some fartleks in your long run. (Since you&#8217;re young and healthy, you can probably get away with some intensity).</li>
<li>&#8220;Allow&#8221; the fun runs, rather than &#8220;plan&#8221; them.</li>
<li>When you&#8217;re assessing your pace and performance, keep in mind the context of your training from the past days.</li>
<li>Lucho recommends doing one session of 5&#215;5 and another complementary session (overhead press, stretch cords, etc.). Don&#8217;t lift too heavy too often.</li>
<li>When &#8220;training for life,&#8221; it&#8217;s important to try different sports and be a well rounded athlete. Try SUP, backpacking, or archery.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Brad M. asks:</b></h2>
<h3><b>Balance between bike &amp; run volume (for LC Tri)</b></h3>
<div>Yo Coaches,</div>
<div>
<div dir="ltr"></div>
<div dir="ltr">What are your thoughts on the balance between bike and run volume for long course triathlon?  I read Jesse Kropelnicki&#8217;s rule of thumb being <b>run</b><b> volume no more than 1/5 of bike volume</b> so that would be something like 40mi run/200mi bike a week.  Have you found a good range/balance for your Kona qualifiers?  Also what range for total volume have you found for your KQ athletes that are 40+. I have done 20-30 hrs/wk in past builds but have been playing with lower volume but higher intensity the last couple of years and am trying to dial in those last few % to try and qualify.  Came pretty close last fall in Florida 9:29 and 6th, 11m from last spot.  Have you ever seen the attached chart? Tri version of Jack Daniels, thoughts? Ran a recent 5K at 17:45 and last year Florida was 3:25 do these line up?</div>
</div>
<div dir="ltr">
<h3>What the Coaches say:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Yes, <a href="http://kropelnicki.com/bikerun-balance-and-discipline-specific-training-blocks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as Jesse Kropelnicki says</a>, traditionally, run volume should be no more than 1/5 of bike volume (for example, 20 mile run week, 100 bike week).
<ul>
<li>BUT, there&#8217;s no hard and fast rule!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You have to be strong enough on the bike to run well.</li>
<li>As Lucho says, the strongest runners are the strongest cyclists.</li>
<li>You need to bike 4:50 again, but run faster. To do that, you need to become a stronger cyclist so you have more juice for the run.</li>
<li>Your 5K time doesn&#8217;t exactly line up with running a 3:10 in an Ironman marathon. You need to make sure your goal pace at Ironman feels easy.</li>
<li>To get faster, you need to add intensity. Once you adapt to higher intensity, you need to bring volume back in.</li>
<li>You can &#8220;focus&#8221; more on the run without changing any volume by moving your long run to the day before your long bike, so you&#8217;re hitting the run with fresh legs and the bike on tired legs.</li>
<li>Use your old logs as a template to inform your future training.</li>

<li>We are not wired for uncertainty or loneliness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why are some people more vulnerable to uncertainty and anxiety than others?
<ul>
<li>Some personality traits may make it harder to cope with stressors, such as uncertainty and loneliness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What’s the best way to go about “checking in” with yourself?
<ul>
<li>We are doing the right thing by physically isolating ourselves right now. You don&#8217;t want to get yourself or others sick, and you don&#8217;t want to spread the infection.</li>
<li>Because we are more isolated, what is going on in our minds becomes more apparent.</li>
<li>Since we are hard-wired to do the opposite of physically isolating ourselves, it&#8217;s important to connect with your compassionate motivation; we have the opportunity to see what&#8217;s going on inside ourselves.</li>
<li>Steps that you can take to improve mental health:
<ul>
<li>Use meditation to calm the mind. Breathing meditations may calm emotions down; your mind becomes slightly calmer, which makes the thoughts that arise slightly less intense and easier to cope with.</li>
<li>Go for a walk outside.</li>
<li>If you can&#8217;t go outside, look outdoors to connect with nature.</li>
<li>Exercise outdoors.</li>
<li>Use your awareness to see what is going on in your mind.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Tools to use to help when working from home?

<li>Julian says: &#8220;We have become distracted from what is important through the stimulation of our desires and our compulsion with external sources of happiness through acquisition. Instead, what we have now is an opportunity to focus on what is important.&#8221;
<ul>
<li>We&#8217;ve evolved to be compassionate, social beings; it&#8217;s fundamental to our survival.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_(book)">Propaganda (book) 1928</a>
<ul>
<li>The beginning of the marketing industry and the deliberate selling of stuff we don&#8217;t need. Which then led to happiness = acquisition.</li>

<ul>
<li>The quality of relationships is key in determining our health, wellbeing, and happiness. <em>Not</em> the acquisition of &#8220;stuff.&#8221;</li>
<li>The first step to developing quality relationships is to be a compassionate, kind person.</li>
<li>Right now, we don&#8217;t want to socially isolate! We want to maintain our relationships while maintaining physical distancing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exercise and race cancelation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is racing the only reason you train?</li>
<li>Try and focus on enjoying the <em>process </em>and not on an external factor (e.g., races)</li>
<li>Racing is just icing on the cake!</li>
<li>Julian says:

<h2><b>Andrew asks:</b></h2>
<h3><b>Daily Double and MAF Drop-off</b></h3>
<div>
<p>Hey guys,</p>
<div dir="auto">
<div dir="auto">
<p>I recently started listening to your show and am really loving it. I&#8217;m a physical therapist by &#8220;trade&#8221; but have also run multiple marathons and identify more as a runner than a PT. I&#8217;ve had a few kids (which cuts into training!) and am starting to get back to it. I have a few questions and just curious what your thoughts are.  I&#8217;m both a coach and a competitor so I&#8217;ve got questions for both sides.</p>
<p>1. What are your thoughts on multiple MAF runs in one day? I&#8217;m training for my first 50 miler and, because of my work/life schedule, multiple runs in one day is how I get a lot of my miles in. Is there a minimum time needed to get benefit? 30 minutes? Obviously, &#8220;how little to train&#8221; is just as murky as &#8220;how much to train&#8221; but I&#8217;m curious if there&#8217;s any data you suggest as a minimum needed to cause physiological change.</p>
<p>2. Is there any significance to the drop off that occurs in a MAF test? Example: a 4 mile test with a total drop of 15 sec/mile (9:00 min/mile @ mile 1 to 9:15 min/mile @ mile 4) vs. a 45 second drop off (9:00-9:45). Would an earlier/quicker drop off be related to lack of condition vs. later/slower be a nutrition/energy availability issue (just a thought)? Is there a difference in how you would train these athletes?  (Not sure what average drop off would be so I apologize if I&#8217;m way off.)</p>
<p>3. In thinking about question 2&#8230; what about drop off during training? How far do you let your pace drop? And can you use the &#8220;rate&#8221; of decline to plan nutrition intake during marathon/ultras? Or is it only useful to monitor progress in general terms?</p>
</div>
<div dir="auto">Thanks guys, keep up the great work! Looking forward to more shows!</div>
</div>
</div>
<h2 dir="auto">What the Coaches say:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Lucho has heard Mark Allen say 3 miles is the minimum effective dose for a short run, while Tawnee has heard 35 minutes is the lowest effective dose to maintain run fitness.</li>
<li>Three factors to bear in mind:
<ul>
<li>How fatigued are you? 3 miles the day after a 20-miler will be much &#8220;harder&#8221; than 3 miles on fresh legs.</li>
<li>How relatively fit are you? 3 miles for someone running 20 miles a week is really different than 3 miles for someone doing 100 miles a week.</li>
<li>What&#8217;s the purpose of the run? A recovery run of 3 miles is fine, but an easy workout run should be 4-7 miles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Frequency does matter in gaining run fitness.</li>
<li>The MAF drop-off is only significant in that it shows your improvement. You can&#8217;t plug it into an algorithm and gain any specific knowledge from it.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re doing a long MAF test (like over 10 miles) then the drop-off might be related to fueling.</li>
<li>If you haven&#8217;t warmed up appropriately, your first two miles on the MAF test will be artificially fast.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s no definitive pace/mile drop that&#8217;s been proven to be permissible.</li>
<li>Rather than drop-off, Lucho is more concerned when a runner&#8217;s pace becomes too slow, so it&#8217;s compromising structural performance (risking injury or illness).</li>
<li>Perceived exertion matters. If you genuinely feel good, even though you&#8217;re technically over MAF, then you&#8217;re fine to keep going.</li>
<li>How durable are you? You can push it if you&#8217;ve done the work to make sure you don&#8217;t get injured.</li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Sandy asks:</b></h2>
<h3><b>Endurance as Submax Exercise and Why the Lack of Strength Training in Endurance Programs?</b></h3>
<div>
<p>Hi Tawnee and Lucho:</p>
<div>Thank you for so many episodes of the podcast and so much dedication to getting the information out there.  Listening each week now enables me to speak confidently with my many endurance friends about lactate thresholds, anaerobic zones and the other minutae of training.  They love that I speak their language!</div>
<div></div>
<div>I am an endurance athlete but also a strength athlete as my sports are rock climbing, sea kayaking, bushwalking (as we call it in Australia) and trail running.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I would be interested in hearing you and Lucho discuss strength training for endurance around the following parameters:</div>
<div></div>
<div>If we assume that endurance is actually a long, continuous series of submaximal contractions, the stronger I am, the better my endurance performance should be as I am using less of my base case of strength for each submaximal contraction.  Durability should also be better in an overall stronger athlete.  Theoretically then any training program should include 1 to 2 days per week of maximum strength training using standard maximum strength guidelines &#8211; say 3 to 4 exercises for 3 to 5 sets of 2 to 4 repetitions at 85 to 90% of 1 RM, but NOT going to failure (hypertrophy probably not desirable for endurance athletes).</div>
<div></div>
<div>What is your opinion of why endurance training programs never feature regular strength training?  Do you program regular strength training for your athletes?  I would be interested in your discussion.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Thank you.</div>
<div>
<h2 dir="auto">What the Coaches say:</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.enduranceplanet.com/atc-305-the-case-for-strength-training-even-when-research-says-it-doesnt-help-realistic-race-goals-approaching-youth-sport-coaches-and-24-hours-of-pullups-say-what/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See Episode 305 for Tawnee and Lucho talking about strength training</a>
<ul>
<li>Tawnee and Lucho discussed why they like ST even when research presents studies that did not show a benefit. You can certainly cherry pick and find articles where ST provided no benefit to athletes in speed, power, pace, economy. They are there. But does that mean it’s wrong?
<ul>
<li>Two studies that showed no benefit:
<ul>
<li><span class="s1"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4783109/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4783109/</a></span></li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li class="p1">On this show, Tawnee and Lucho discuss this study: <a style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;" href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-scj/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=2015&amp;issue=04000&amp;article=00001&amp;type=Fulltext">Strength Training for Endurance Athletes: Theory to Practice</a>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Evidence shows more than 25 years of research supporting ST efficacy and application for EAs.</li>
<li class="p1">“Endurance in sport has been defined as the ability to maintain or repeat a given force or power output.”</li>
<li class="p1">“Strength can be defined as the ability to produce force. Strength is a skill, which can be expressed in a magnitude of 0–100%.”</li>
<li class="p1">Two primary forms of strength training have been investigated:
<ul>
<li class="p1">Maximal, <b>high-force, low-velocity, strength training (HFLV)</b></li>
<li class="p1">Explosive, <b>low-force, high-velocity strength training</b> <b>(LFHV)</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="p1">Both low-intensity exercise endurance and high-intensity exercise endurance have been shown to improve as a result of HFLV and LFHV ST</li>
<li class="p1">Better to periodize than trying to improve all at once</li>
<li class="p1">Also look to limitations in study design (eg controlling for volume etc), and this goes both ways whether a study found a positive or negative outcome with ST.</li>
<li class="p1">“Strength training has been reported to increase musculotendinous unit stiffness. This results in an enhanced ability to store elastic energy in the series and parallel elastic component during eccentric muscle actions, which in turn increases concentric muscle force.”</li>
<li class="p1">“The superior performance changes with heavier strength training may be attributed to greater increases in musculotendinous unit stiffness, greater recruitment of high-threshold motor units, and greater capacity to store and release elastic energy, which lead to a right and upward shift in the force-velocity and force-power relationships.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tawnee&#8217;s Thoughts:
<ul>
<li>What we can do best here is a “cost benefit analysis” for each athlete and through their season:</li>
<li>The first question to ask is in what case (either theoretical or literal) is ST “bad” to endurance athletes?
<ul>
<li>Fatiguing</li>
<li>Waste of time</li>
<li>Takes away from time/stress that could be spent endurance training (is the tradeoff worth it?)</li>
<li>Doesn’t result in any benefits to main sport(s)</li>
<li>Boring/not enjoyable</li>
<li>Introduces new risk of injury or something else deleterious</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meanwhile, the next question to ask is what benefits could ST provide:
<ul>
<li>Improved body comp</li>
<li>Healthy hormonal balance (endurance depletes; strength can rebuild)</li>
<li>Improved durability and muscular endurance</li>
<li>Musculotendinous unit stiffness (HFLV); running &gt; cycling b/c SSC</li>
<li>Motor unit recruitment (HFLV)</li>
<li>Store/release elastic energy (HFLV)</li>
<li>Peak force (HFLV)</li>
<li>Injury resilience</li>
<li>Lighter loads at higher velocity can improve RFD</li>
<li>More balanced body (anterior/posterior, planes of motion, proper mobility, etc)</li>
<li>Better movers (this is not necessarily everyone but where deficiency is clear should be addressed)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Training plans have to be individualized based on the athlete&#8217;s goals, capacities, and inclination.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s a lot of skinny endurance athletes who could benefit from hypertrophy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Welcome to episode 16 of Holistic Performance Nutrition (HPN) featuring <a href="http://coachtawnee.com/">Tawnee Gibson</a>, MS, CSCS, CISSN, and Julie McCloskey, a certified holistic nutrition coach who you can find over at <a href="http://wildandwell.fit/">wildandwell.fit</a>.</p>
<p>On this episode:</p>
<h2><b>Jaquelyn asks:</b></h2>
<h3><b>Diet Approach while MAF Training</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey Tawnee! I’ve loved the podcast for many many years. I&#8217;m a long distance triathlete and dabble in the marathon. I recently changed coaches and I am embracing the MAF method for the first time. I have been listening about it for years but I&#8217;m finally a student of the philosophy! I think its amazing and I&#8217;m already seeing alot of progress. My question is related to diet while using MAF. I have always had more of a high intensity approach and I&#8217;m feeling I need to revamp the area of nutrition as well. Can you give me an idea of the best balance of macros to maintain my weight and fuel my workouts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More details: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m 36 year old female. 135lbs and 5’7. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have been following a Mediterranean style diet for many years. Fairly low carb because I&#8217;m really drawn to veggies over starches. </span><strong>I ran into some hypoglycemia issues about a year ago so I have added more low glycemic carbs</strong>.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> I am feeling better and my blood sugars are more stable. But I do feel like I&#8217;m massively under fueling for workouts and training. I have alot of problems with the last half of the ironman/70.3 run. Although I have never had any gastric issues races, I just never can race to my potential. My new coach decided to build my aerobic system with a MAF style approach and I&#8217;m curious on how to eat with this new concept. I was doing a low volume high intensity approach for many years. I&#8217;m a very busy person, work full time as a dental assistant, own a beef cattle farm, and love, love long distance triathlons. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am currently eating 1800-2000 calories a day. 40% carb, 30% fat, 30% protein. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tried closer to 2300 calories with a 50/20/30 but I was so full all the time it was hard to train! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am currently in a base phase of training, race July 12. </span><strong>15-18 hours training in all MAF Heart rate</strong>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> except for my couple tests I do every 3 weeks.</span></p>
<h3>What the Coaches say:</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">1800 calories with a 40% carbohydrates (180g), 30% fat (60g), and 30% protein (135g)</span>
<ul>
<li>This is likely to be too low in fat and overall calories</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2000 calories with a 40% carbohydrates (200g), 30% fat (67g), and 30% protein (150g)
<ul>
<li>This is likely too low in fat, and maybe even too much protein. 200g of CHO (carbohydrates) is okay on heavier training days (higher volume MAF), but it doesn&#8217;t need to be that high every day</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommended:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PRO: Adjust PRO to about 100-130g/day (e.g., 2g/kg/bm), likely not much more needed than that. Only more than 2g/kg under special circumstances such as injury healing, bodybuilding, etc.</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Too much prot</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ein (i.e., more than your body needs) could cause excess amino acids being used for gluconeogenesis where the liver converts amino acids from protein into glucose. This is a totally normal process that occurs on a regular basis, but it may increase when protein intake is very high, which is not something that we need or want.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11079744/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High protein diet is accompanied by increased stimulation of glucagon and insulin within the endocrine pancreas, high glycogen turnover and stimulation of gluconeogenesis.</span></a>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glucagon is a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">peptide hormone, produced by alpha cells of the pancreas. It works to raise the concentration of glucose and fatty acids in the bloodstream and is considered to be the main catabolic hormone of the body. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glucagon raises blood sugar, insulin reduces blood sugar.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FAT: Increase </span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only ~60-70g/day or so isn’t necessarily a bad thing. The coaches are not suggesting LCHF, however, your body may be starved of some healthy fats that you need. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAF is a metabolic approach to allow the body to be more efficient with fat. Higher healthy fat intake is complementary. Carbs NOT bad, but low fat is not ideal.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BOOST fat to 100g+ (increasing fat on lower carb days is KEY, too).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Example of a fairly typical day of healthy fats:</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2 TBSP grassfed butter = 24g fat (200cal). Great for women especially. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2 pastured organic eggs = 9g fat (140cal)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">½ avocado = 12g fat (130cal)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 TBSP olive oil = 13g fat (120cal)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4oz grassfed ground beef (85/15) = 17g fat (240 cal)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">15 almonds = 9g fat (100cal)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 TBSP avocado oil = 14g fat (124 cal)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3.5oz wild king salmon = 13g fat (230cal)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2 squares 85% dark chocolate = 9g fat (113cal)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TOTAL = 120g FAT (1080cal)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CHO: Allow for carb cycling, where on heavy training days and maybe even the day after (whether volume or intensity) allow for 200g/CHO give or take, but on lighter training days, carbs can drop to ~120-150/g day and on those days. Making these small changes based on output will help with weight maintenance goal. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CALORIES:</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Say you’re training 15hr week, moderate-intensity/MAF (10min/mile) + daily activities. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exercise: burning up to 1300 calories a day from training.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basal Metabolic Rate: ballpark of 1660 calories.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus factor in other calories burned through daily movement, activities, etc. (few hundred calories maybe?)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around 3200 calories a day to meet your energy needs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">So at 2000 cal/day or less, you’re drastically underfueling.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If having trouble eating over 2k a day, may look at gut health, nutrient timing, types of foods pre-training, etc.</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">E.g. SIBO causes a feeling of fullness, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or try to eat lower veggie and lower carbs PRE training and focus on legit carb refuels post-training.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Definitely see a place for low glycemic grains and higher fats to incorporate pre-training. E.g., 2 tbsp butter on toast with 1-2 eggs. Or a bowl of oats with chia seeds, coconut butter, protein powder.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe explore UCAN for blood sugar control and meeting calorie/carb needs. Blend into a smoothie?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would try to eat within an hour of waking up and every 2-3 hours</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For sure eating as soon as you can post-workout; if you’re not doing this it could be that one thing that makes a huge difference.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Top off meals with higher calorie foods like olives, nuts, butter on veg, avocado. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always have food with you, make a big smoothie to sip on during the day</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What about the possibly be unintentionally not eating enough by trying to eat healthy? Thinking too much about macros? Seems to be a tracker, has the traits of this mindset. I would make some of these changes, track for a couple of weeks, and once you find a way of eating that feels best, loosen the reigns</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final point: increase calories and fat, decrease protein, carb cycle, make sure you’re eating before and after workouts</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will 1. Help you not feel so full and 2. Help you “race to potential!”</span></li>

<h2><b>Ken asks:</b></h2>
<h3><b>Old guy trying to lose pounds and gain speed</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey guys love the show, long time listener, your podcast is #1 with me!  Here&#8217;s my que</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">stion and sorry for the length, hope you can reply. Thanks so much. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a 67 ½ year old triathlete I’ve come to accept a decline in my race and training performance over the years but can’t help but be frustrated by 2 nagging issues in my attempt to remain fit and injury free. These issues are run performance and body weight and I’m losing my battle to control both. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some quick background, as I said I’ll be 68 in 2020 and am a short but muscular male, 5’ 4” tall and weighing about 145 in season and 150 or more in the outseason. I came to triathlon and road running late in life, starting at the age of 59. Since then I’m a 2 time Ironman finisher @ Lake Placid in 2012 and Maryland 2014; 14 time finisher in Half-Ironman, Rev3, Challenge Family and HITS 70.3’s; 2 marathons, 9 half marathons, and a whole bunch of shorter triathlon and running races like Oly Tri’s, 5K’s, 10K’s etc. over the last 10 years. I’m generally a mid to back of the packer with my best performance at IM Maryland when I was 62 finishing in 13:14 and 10th in my age group. Never a fast runner, my best 5K was around 24 minutes and best half marathon around 2 hours flat. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m fine with my times overall but am always looking to improve and feel that it’s my running that has had the biggest dropoff and needs the most help. </span><b>To that end I’ve been increasing my running mileage since the start of 2020 from 10 miles per week to 15 and this week hopefully 20.  I feel my sweet spot for remaining injury free is under 40 miles a week and I hope to reach that by March. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My issue is that my running pace never improves and all my slow, easy training runs feel hard. Even when I include threshold runs and sprint intervals and strength work I NEVER get faster. I would be happy with even some of my easy 5 miles runs to feel easy but they don’t and I have to stop and walk consistently throughout the runs.  I attribute a lot of that to some injuries that have slowed me down over the years </span><b>but I mostly blame </b><b><i>my crazy inability to lose weight</i></b><b>. I can’t help but be envious of my training buddies in my age range who are running easy at an 8:30 pace while I struggle at 11:00 minute miles! </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one common feature they all have is they are long and lean. While I’ll never be long, I figure I can try being lean and for my height it’s not the 150 lbs I carry now but more like 130 &#8211; 135. </span><b>And my waist size is alarmingly big for a guy my size; over the last 10 years it went from 30-31 inches to now 35-36 inches!! WTF!</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always a healthy eater (no junk food, none), I’ve tried a new approach of the last 6 weeks to get lean and closer to my ideal body weight of 135 or less to see if that would help my running and overall fitness.  I’ve been doing intermittent fasting for 5 days each week along with LCHF. I track my calorie intake daily and it’s rarely over 1800 calories a day. A typical day for me would be one hour workout like a Zwift bike ride or spin class, or a 3-5 mile run, strength training, swimming and even some golf walking the course. Meals are limited to 2, the first around noon or 1:00 pm usually 2 eggs, 2-3 slices of bacon, half an avocado with coffee with half and half. A snack would be a cup of cottage cheese or some slices of cheddar cheese and a piece of fruit and maybe a few (3-4) whole grain pretzels. Dinner is a protein like beef, chicken pork or fish with a salad and a side vegetable. Usually I’ll have a glass of wine or an ipa to wash it all down although lately I’ve given up both and drink green tea. On the weekends I don’t fast but my food intake doesn’t increase significantly and I’m rarely over 2500 calories. I started all of this December 9th and now as I write this it’s January 13. In all that time I’ve gone from 151 lbs to 149. Even allowing for the holidays and the occasional cheats on the weekend this is nuts. I mean if this were even a simple low calorie weight watchers diet I’d expect to lose more than this lousy 2 lbs? What’s going on? Is it slow metabolism, hormones, thyroid? Should I see an endocrinologist or a nutritionist or what? Any thoughts would be really appreciated. Help please!</span></p>
<h3>What the Coaches say:</h3>
<p><b>Waist to height ratio:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If waist circumference is half your height or more</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that can signify a potential problem.</span></li>
<li>Study: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5671970/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Prevalence of Overfat Adults and Children in the US</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">(Maffetone, Larson)</span>
<ul>
<li>“Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that increased abdominal fat, assessed through WC and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), can predict adiposity-related risk (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5671970/#B37">37</a>). WHtR was more strongly related to cardiometabolic risk factors than BMI (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5671970/#B29">29</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5671970/#B44">44</a>). In normal-weight non-obese children with a commonly used cutoff of WHtR ≥ 0.5, over 55% had one to three cardiometabolic health risk factors associated with increases in WC, triglycerides, and blood pressure (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5671970/#B45">45</a>). Adults from the NHANES, 1999–2000 cohort showed that 86% of adults with abdominal obesity [defined as WC in men ≥ 102 cm (40″), in women ≥88 cm (35″)] had at least one other cardiometabolic risk factor (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5671970/#B46">46</a>).”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Troubleshooting/ideas:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Potentially adopt a more plant-based diet (not vegan, still suggesting animal-based proteins!) but right now you&#8217;re consuming a lot of meats, fats, &amp; acidic foods without a lot of colorful fresh produce. </span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swap the bacon for colors</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swap the cheese for colors</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the salad and vegetable portion of your dinner is as small as I suspect it to be, increase that</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get blood labs with full thyroid panel, lipids, iron, CBC, hbA1c, etc.</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free T3, Free T4, Total T3, Total T4, TSH, TPO Abs., Thyroglobulin, etc.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Definitely get a DUTCH test &#8211; would like to see cortisol patterns (not just in blood serum but cortisol trends and overall HPA axis function) and sex hormones. </span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is stress an issue?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overtraining- not just now but over the years?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low Testosterone?</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Testosterone decreases after 40 by 1-2%/year</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responsible for regulating fat distribution and muscle strength. Less T, less effective at burning calories</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for running: </span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rarely do I see 10-15mpw lead to significant fitness gains/speed.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe put triathlon on hold and invest in running focus? This has been a great strategy for my athletes who are weaker in the run.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you can handle 30-40mpw of 80/20 this is probably going to yield good results + add strength training as injury preventative (single leg exercises!).</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nutritionally, maybe intermittent fasting not the right strategy for you. Listen to <a href="https://www.enduranceplanet.com/hpn-15-is-keto-bad-for-bone-health-plus-the-risks-of-intermittent-fasting-for-female-athletes-and-why-we-say-a-hard-no/">our last HPN show:</a> within day energy deficiency associated with metabolic disturbance.</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add in smaller more frequent meals.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start measuring blood glucose to get an idea of what’s going on:</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fasting and postprandial at 1, 2, or 3hr after meals. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to keep blood sugar as stable as possible.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Isabelle asks:</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>50 and Breaking 3:30 in the Marathon?</strong></h3>
<p>Hi Tawny and Lucho,</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a fan since 2011 and I listen to all (well almost all) of your podcasts. These days I&#8217;m training for Boston. As I am self coached I often come up with questions but no one around can answer them, so I thought: I should just ask Tawny and Lucho!</p>
<p>Here is a bit (or a lot) about me. I&#8217;m 49, turning 50 in 2020. I could tell you my height and weight but maybe it&#8217;s not relevant so let&#8217;s just say, I&#8217;m not too big or too thin I don&#8217;t think. My body type is on the more muscular side and when I got my genes tested, it said I&#8217;m a power athlete (alas not an endurance one) mainly because I&#8217;m double deleted in the ACE gene&#8230;I don&#8217;t think you ever spoke about that in your podcasts so it would be interesting to know what you think about this. I started doing triathlon when I was 35 and competed in mostly Olympics and some half and two IM when I had more time to train as a stay at home mom to two boys (13 and 15). Now I&#8217;m back to work but my husband is at home! I quit triathlon and does mostly running (and a little swimming and x-country skiing with the family).</p>
<p>My first marathon I did CIM in 4:02 with maybe 35 miles per week training. For my second marathon in 2016, I decided to train more and I followed the Hanson&#8217;s method, which at the time found really hard especially going up to 50 miles per week. I did 3:44 and qualified for Boston (yeah!). For my first Boston in 2018 I trained again with the Hanson&#8217;s doing only up to 16 miles for my long runs. This was the year where they had a storm but I still did pretty well in 3:40. Came back the next year (2019) and decided to increase the mileage a bit with the same program. I wanted to break 3:30. I did 3:36. OK. Now of course I have to hire a coach, I&#8217;m doing NY the same year. She trained me like I never trained before. In August I did 18, 19, 20 and 20 on the week-ends. I was just exhausted. Then she had me take a break early September doing nothing (weird but I&#8217;m paying her, so I&#8217;m gonna do what she says). Coming back into it mid-September, I felt like superwomen. Then in September and October I ramped back up to 20 mi. The problem is I felt like I had lost the fitness because the ramp up was pretty slow.  Anyway, did the race: 3:36 again! I was devastated, after all that training. What went wrong? On the positive side I must say that my pace was pretty steady the whole time and did not deteriorate so much like in my previous Bostons&#8230;</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m back into training for Boston. Still doing the Hanson&#8217;s with added mileage. I&#8217;m planning on going up to 20 miles long run again (but not as many, maybe going 18, 20 and 19). Also will try to go up to 70 mi/wk. Honestly I can&#8217;t do more than that or else I have to do 2 runs per day and I would never see my kids. I already get up at 4:45 and come back from work at 6 and goes to bed at 8pm (pretty boring).</p>
<p>Some other notes: I do strength training early in the season (DL, back squat and other things) I&#8217;m not injury prone thanks to Jay and the Balanced Runner whom I discovered on your podcast!</p>
<p>Here are my questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What should I do differently to break 3:30? Train for a 5k? Try to run 2x on the weekends? Do a different program? Jack Daniels maybe?</li>
<li>Is breaking 3:30 in the realms of possibility since I&#8217;m not getting younger?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks so much, love you guys and the podcast.</p>
<p>Forgot to mention a very important info. Here are different times at other distances. Which tells me I should be able to go 3:30?</p>
<p>Mile: 6:14</p>
<p>5k: 21:30</p>
<p>Half-Marathon: 1:39:50</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What the Coaches say:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>At a certain time in your season, the long run should be your key run and the thing you want to focus on adapting to. It would be worth cutting down your overall volume so you can adapt to a 20-mile long run. Once you feel comfortable running 20 miles, then you can add and adapt to other stressors.
<ul>
<li>You highest volume should be 20 weeks out from the race. Then you can work on intensity. 8 weeks out, you can start focusing on volume at race pace.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Four individual long runs doesn&#8217;t make or break a year. With coronavirus stopping racing for now, now might be a good time to try Luchos&#8217; 20&#215;20.</li>
<li>Remember, your genes are not your destiny! You can absolutely succeed at marathons, even if your disposition is for power efforts.</li>
<li>Your previous training logs will be a great guide for your future training.</li>
<li>Your age (50) doesn&#8217;t matter! You have a lot more potential here.</li>
<li>A foundation of speed will definitely work in your favor for marathon training.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Janice asks:</strong></h2>
<h3 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>MAF &amp; Marathoning in Your 50s</strong></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Hi Tawnee and Lucho</p>
<p>I love you guys! I hope you can help me figure this out. I have a question regarding MAF and marathon training. (Sorry for yet another MAF question)</p>
<p>My history:</p>
<p>&#8211; I&#8217;m a 56-year-old female runner.</p>
<p>&#8211; have run 15 marathons &#8211; last one 2006.</p>
<p>&#8211; run many 10K, half marathons.</p>
<p>&#8211; a few oddball races such as a 64 km ultra.</p>
<p>&#8211; stopped running marathons as it was just too hard and I wasn&#8217;t improving so I decided to focus on half marathons and 10Ks. I struggled over the last 14 years gaining momentum as I would see progress then get injured &#8211; mostly lower leg injuries.</p>
<p>I feel like I have one more marathon in me and I was lucky enough to get a spot in the 2020 Berlin marathon. I ran it 30 years ago! I am not a fast runner (marathon PR was 4:01 way back in 1999). My goal is Plan A is to be about 5 hours and Plan B is to finish. (As of today, Berlin has not been canceled, but even if it is canceled my question applies to the next race).</p>
<p>I seem to recall this coming up in another podcast where Lucho had said for someone my age and skill &#8211; that MAF was best &#8211; to keep healthy and to just finish. So back in September 2019, I did my first MAF test and my schedule is 4 days/week run at MAF(124 bpm) and one day at a faster pace &#8211; almost a tempo pace(depends on how I feel). So 80% MAF and 20%, not MAF. So this was fine for a while, MAF pace dropping slightly, it&#8217;s slow going but that seems to be how my body reacts. However, now as I start to increase mileage for the marathon I find that I am walking almost 95% of the time to keep my heart rate at MAF. To be honest, I&#8217;m usually on average about 128 bpm especially if there is a hill. At 124 bpm I am barely walking.</p>
<p>For example, today I did 20 km at an 11:11/km which meant I was out for 3:43, which was mostly brisk walking.</p>
<p>So my question is:  my training is mostly walking so how will I be able to actually <strong>run</strong> a race? Is the MAF training just teaching me to walk long distances? Is being out for almost 4 hours and only covering 20 km harming my progress to actually run? I was planning on doing two half marathons one in May and one in July leading up to Berlin in September &#8211; again not racing them but just getting the race prep and fueling in order. These two races are canceled this year but if I was to do them on my own or virtually, I don&#8217;t know if I could <u>run</u> 21.1 km as my training has been 95% walking at MAF-ish. As I increase mileage for the marathon &#8211; how does MAF fit in? Will I be out there for 6 hours or longer? Don&#8217;t I need to actually run at some point on my long run? On the plus side, I feel good after my long &#8220;run&#8221;. I guess what I am trying to say is that I&#8217;m worried I might not be training to run, or my long time out there by walking will cause harm. I&#8217;m confused. Am I on the right path?</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What the Coaches say:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Article mention: science of MAF in a n<span class="s1">ew paper by Dr. Phil Maffetone and Paul Laursen</span>
<ul>
<li><span class="s1"><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2020.00296/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maximum Aerobic Function: Clinical Relevance, Physiological Underpinnings, and Practical Application</a></span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There&#8217;s nothing that indicates you should be going backwards, so that suggests something&#8217;s not working right&#8230; fatigue maybe? HR too low&#8211; probably.</li>
<li>Tawnee would suggest doing an LT test to determine your zone 2 (as long as that intensity wouldn&#8217;t risk exacerbating your former injury!) and training there, even if it&#8217;s higher than MAF. See if that allows you to improve.</li>
<li>Try going out and running for one week by feel at a MAF intensity (you should be able to breath easily through your nose). Track your HR over that time, and use that number in the future if it&#8217;s different from your true MAF.</li>
<li>You do need to run to be able to run a marathon. Walking can be a valuable part of training, but, at the end of the day, you do need to run.</li>
<li>Consider getting lab testing to see where your actually crossover point is, and then go by that HR.</li>
<li>Intensity shouldn&#8217;t be coming into the equation here.</li>
<li>Be diligent about PT exercises and maintenance work to prevent re-injury.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Lee Smith asks: </strong></h2>
<h3 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>MAF and Triathlon Training &#8211; 80/20 or more intensity?</strong></h3>
<p>Hi Tawnee and Lucho, greetings from a wet and stormy UK! Great podcast, found you guys recently through following Tawnees video interviews with Primal Mastery online. Thank you for the great insights and entertaining content.</p>
<p>My main goal for this question is to not have Lucho saying ‘we don’t need to read this whole thing through’ while mock-snoring!</p>
<p>My background: 51 years old, decent school runner many years ago, track, cross country and played lots of football (the real football, not USA!), abandoned sports all through my misspent 20s, started running again early 30s, started triathlons 12 years ago. My results are weighted towards running, PBs 19 min 5k, 39 min 10k, 3:20 marathon. My biking is mid-pack at best (6 hour 112 mile). Swimming ok, 68 mins PB for 2.4. I would love to qualify for Kona, which is my middle-aged version of my school boy dream of playing for Liverpool FC!</p>
<p>Basically I’d like some advice on MAF as applied to triathlon training as most of what I understand of MAF stems from running literature. I’ve been pretty devoted to an 80/20 MAF approach at my 130 bpm rate for about a year, with decent results (<strong>now at 7:40-50 / mile for a 5 mile track test from a start point last year of just under 10 mins</strong>). I am currently training for my first triathlons since I started MAF (I have a 70.3 in June 2020, full IM September 2020 in Portugal). Having started a Training Peaks program and done a build phase for the 70.3, <strong>I am now torn between continuing 80/20 MAF, or more closely following the written plan introducing much more tempo / intensity.</strong> I had always followed the Brad Kearns / Phil Maffetone view, that you just stick to training aerobically and, come race day, your body will be able to race just like our ancestors did away from a sabre tooth tiger. However that was while I was just training, not racing. With a couple of actual races scheduled (that I have paid for!) I am now much more skeptical about this! I’m sure some of our ancestors got caught by those tigers, didn’t they? So I’m not sure whether to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>a) </strong>maintain the MAF fitness I’ve built so far and continue 80/20 MAF right up to the June 70.3, and treat that race like a high quality training event, as a build to the September full, or</li>
<li><strong>b) </strong>go more hell for leather for the 70.3, then recalibrate with MAF through June &#8211; July, and build again for the full through August?</li>
</ul>
<p>Last question guys, do you have any guidelines / suggestions about a MAF focus for running off the bike? My brick runs so far (all on treadmills after a Wattbike session) have started with a 1-2 mile high HR (160 + bpm), but then reassuringly stabilise to closer to my 130 MAF for a couple of miles, before drifting upwards again to mid 140s. My pace for these runs are about 8:30 min miles and increasing through the run to nearer to 8 mins. What do you think of a much more focussed approach of slower running with the aim of being much more aligned with MAF throughout the run, perhaps even walking the first mile or so to bring down that spike effect off the bike, with the goal of my specific off the bike run pace getting quicker over a longer time period?</p>
<p>By the way, I have a woodway curve TM in my gym (I don’t use that for these bricks). You were wondering about the effect on MAF of curve sessions during your recent show. My own results are 8:50 mins / mile for a 1 hour test, around 1 min &#8211; 50 secs slower than my standard tests. RPE is higher due to the continuous uphill effect.</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What the Coaches say:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Stick to 80/20, don&#8217;t add more intensity beyond that.</li>
<li>Adding tempo should be good for you. It&#8217;s 70.3 pace, something you can hold for 4 hours. This isn&#8217;t really &#8220;intensity.&#8221;</li>
<li>You should always take intensity with a grain of salt when you&#8217;re talking about the bike or swim. Since these two are non-load bearing, the risk of injury is negligible.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ve achieved a lot with MAF, so it seems like you&#8217;re in a good place to experiment with adding intensity.</li>
<li>Get a feel for your HR when you run off the bike. Some people have a high or low HR. Figure out your normal and use that to make sure you don&#8217;t start too hard. If you lose 30 seconds in the first mile, so what?! If you come off the bike and start at one-minute-too-fast, you might blow your race. But if you start one-minute-slow, you can easily catch that up! Your MAF HR should be a cap, not a goal off the bike.
<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t be too concerned about your pace in relation to your HR.</li>

<li>Undersypply affects 20% of postpartum women.</li>
<li>Mother&#8217;s milk supply is largely determined by postpartum hormones in the beginning, but at a certain point (around 8-10 weeks), it becomes based more on supply and demand.</li>
<li>There are many different versions of tongue-ties. Have your baby properly checked for tongue-tie issues (it&#8217;s more common than we realize).</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t go low calorie thinking you need to jump weight loss because your milk supply may be affected.</li>
<li>No intermittent fasting; it&#8217;s too much stress on the body.</li>
<li>For some women with low supply, there are data suggesting that the keto diet can work well.</li>

<h2>Article discussion:</h2>
<h3>The right kind of exercise to help boost your immune system</h3>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095254618301005#fig0001">The compelling link between physical activity and the body&#8217;s defense system.</a>&#8221;
<ul>
<li>This one is super in-depth!</li>
<li>Upper-respiratory infections increased when no exercise was present.</li>
<li>Hard exercise (marathon distance) also increased likelihood of infection.</li>
<li>Moderate exercise decreased risk of infection.</li>
<li>Low calorie diets also increase your risk of getting sick.</li>
<li>Volume and intensity can diminish your immune system when you go outside what you&#8217;re adapted to.</li>
<li>Tawnee&#8217;s takeaway: stick to MAF right now. With races cancelled, now&#8217;s <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> the time to try to set PRs or crush your workouts. Just focus on comfortably and safely building your base.</li>
<li>Lucho&#8217;s takeaway: pay attention to your mental health. Don&#8217;t do any workout that feels like a mental stress.</li>

<h2><strong>Marco W. asks:</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Cancelled Spring Marathon Because of COVID-19, What To Do?</strong></h3>
<p>How would you handle the training if you cannot run any spring marathon because of covid-19 and instead aim at running in the falls? End the current cycle and start a new one? Transition smoothly between both? I just don’t wanna lose what I’ve been gaining for this training cycle.</p>
<p>Best regards from Belgium,<br />
Marco</p>
<p>PS: I wish you to remain strong and healthy. That’s what matters most!</p>
<h3>What the Coaches say:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You&#8217;re going to lose your marathon-specific fitness that you have right now, and that&#8217;s a good thing. You have 30 weeks to regain that fitness, which is great. Pullout now and have a rest block. This doesn&#8217;t mean laying on the couch. Recoup as necessary (1-5 days). Then jog easy every other day about 5K for a week. After that, you want to maintain your basic aerobic fitness by reducing your fitness to 50% for the next month.</li>
<li>We all need to have this new reality about what we should be doing right now. We should not be trying to maintain peak fitness.</li>
<li>Look at this unexpected period as a gift to rest and recover so we can come back stronger in the fall.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Scott asks:</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>What Now?</strong></h3>
<p>Dear Coaches,</p>
<p>They canceled my event due to the Coronavirus. I have been training for this marathon since mid December. I have followed my training plan to the letter. I hit all of my key workouts: long runs, intervals, hill repeats and tempo runs. I was ready to crush it. The event is not giving refunds but if we finish the race they will send us our finishers T-shirt. I wanted to try and compete for a podium finish.</p>
<p>Question: Do I do the virtual race? I really thrive on the energy of having hundreds of others around me to push me along.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to say if there will be another opportunity anytime soon but how do you motivate yourself to do a 26.2 mile virtual race? And if you don&#8217;t do the same course as others then how can you say that you really made the podium or gauge how you have done in comparison to others.</p>
<p>I agree to the caution that society is taking in light of the health concerns but I really just wanted to voice my frustrations. Sorry if I sound superficial.</p>
<p>Kindest Regards,</p>
<p>Scott</p>
<h3>What the Coaches say:</h3>
<ul>
<li>What situation are you in in terms of family? Don&#8217;t put others at risk by pushing yourself, possibly getting sick, and passing that on to loved ones.
<ul>
<li>Instead of going for the podium, consider just finishing the race as easily as possible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you don&#8217;t feel like you&#8217;re putting yourself or others at risk, then go for it!</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Amy asks:</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>How to mentally deal?</strong></h3>
<p>I&#8217;ll admit, my sport (triathlon) is a big part of my identity, for better or for worse. And now this spring (possibly even this year) it seems to be looking like no racing will happen. I&#8217;m already going a little crazy and feel lost, and it&#8217;s adding stress which I know isn&#8217;t good. How do I revise my training is one question (I focus on Olys and 70.3s), but I&#8217;m also curious to hear the coaches&#8217; thoughts on how to mentally deal with all these abrupt changes due to the coronavirus. I think we&#8217;re all feeling a bit lost and isolated right now. PS &#8211; I don&#8217;t want to sound like a selfish jerk, as I know there are worse problems in the world right now, but I&#8217;m just being honest.</p>
<h3>What the Coaches say:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The races will still be there when this is all over. Have faith that you&#8217;ll get back to your normal.</li>
<li>Your identity hasn&#8217;t changed just because your races have been temporarily moved. You&#8217;re not quitting. You are still a triathlete whether or not you have a race on the books. You choose to be a triathlete.</li>
<li>Find comfort by virtually connecting with other people in the same boat. Consider Zwift for the treadmill or bike and still count yourself as part of the triathlon community.</li>
<li>Start looking ahead to what you can do in the future.</li>
<li>Use this time to explore other aspects of your identity. Not that it&#8217;s bad for your entire identity to be wrapped up in triathlon. But if there are other important elements in your life, figure out how to develop those more.</li>

        <hr class="shhh">
      </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.lifelongendurance.com/coaches">Lexi Miller</a> is a Colorado-based running coach and community manager at <a href="http://lifelongendurance.com">Lifelong Endurance</a>. She previously worked in the mental health field, primarily with adults recovering from eating disorders (ED). On this show, we discuss the psychology of EDs, disordered eating and body dysmorphia, and particularly athletes suffering from one or more of these conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>On this show:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What is the difference between an eating disorder and disordered eating?
<ul>
<li>Individuals with an eating disorder are clinically diagnosable. Examples of eating disorders include: anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, orthorexia, binge-eating disorder, and food aversions.</li>
<li>Disordered eating doesn&#8217;t fall into those categories above, but it is a term used for unhealthy eating behaviors/worries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It&#8217;s imperative to understand <em>why</em> an athlete wants to go on a diet.</li>
<li>Lexi is a huge fan of intuitive eating. She doesn&#8217;t like to label food as &#8220;good&#8221; or &#8220;bad.&#8221; In her practice, she might encourage individuals to look at protein and carbohydrates and when they will serve the body best in regards to performance and recovery. However, if someone is at-risk or fixating, she recommends seeing a nutrition specialist.</li>
<li>What characteristics do &#8220;good athletes&#8221; and someone with an eating disorder have in common?
<ul>
<li>Rigidity and lack of flexibility</li>
<li>Over compliance, over coachability, and dependence</li>
<li>Obsession</li>
<li>All-or-nothing personality</li>
<li>Study: <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10640269908249284">“Good Athlete” Traits and Characteristics of Anorexia Nervosa: Are They Similar?</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is a value in having the right coach that can monitor and encourage health.</li>
<li>These disordered traits are more prevalent than we realize. One of the hardest things about eating disorders and disordered eating is that so few people get help because they are looked at as being normal. To outsiders, the individuals are seen as looking great and healthy, but it&#8217;s far from the truth.</li>
<li>Men (and athletes) are underdiagnosed because they are encouraged by society to push through pain. In our society, it&#8217;s glorified to be mentally tough, self-resilient, and self-disciplined; to not do that, is a sign of weakness.</li>
<li>If any of this is resonating with you: seek support, make an appointment with a therapist.</li>
<li>How would someone know if they have a binge eating disorder?
<ul>
<li>Eating for comfort rather than hunger, eating due to an obsession, eating past the point of being full and to an uncomfortable level.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How would a coach help guide someone in the right direction if they are exhibiting these traits?
<ul>
<li>Talk about how amazing the human body is.</li>
<li>Have positive conversations about how the athlete feels in their bodies.</li>
<li>Having conversations about how bodies change over time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Coaches should create a healthy dialogue but also encourage an athlete to seek help when needed!</li>
<li>Stay away from complimenting people&#8217;s bodies.</li>
<li>Can people fully recover from an eating disorder?
<ul>
<li>Yes and no</li>
<li>Be aware of your triggers</li>
<li>Be aware of your thoughts and stories you&#8217;re telling yourself</li>
<li>Continue to keep a close support network</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can people integrate recovery while participating in sport?
<ul>
<li>Individuals can get to a point where they can train <em>and</em> work on recovery. But recovery has to be your priority.</li>
<li>Ask yourself why training is so important right now.</li>
<li>Schedule an appointment with a dietitian or therapist.</li>
<li>Start practicing mindfulness and meditation.</li>
<li>Does the sport bring you joy?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Write down your values! Make sure you have a balance in your life.</li>
<li>Orthorexia is an obsession with eating clean and healthy foods.</li>
<li>Two resources mentioned:

<h2><b>Janine asks:</b></h2>
<h3><b>Maintaining Endurance Base during strength focus</b></h3>
<div>
<p>I’ve been a listener and fan of Endurance Planet for several years now, but this is my first time writing in with a question.  Thanks for all the great content &#8211; I really appreciate your work! My main question is:  How much endurance training is needed weekly to maintain a moderate endurance base during a period of more focused strength training? Background:  I’m a 49-year-old female with some background in running and triathlon since my early 30s.  I’ve completed a few marathons as well as various distance triathlons (my only Ironman race was 8 years ago, I’ve been doing shorter distances recently).  I am somewhat injury-prone, having struggled with IT band and piriformis issues multiple times.  I’m also a martial arts athlete, and have had 2 knee surgeries (ACL, meniscus) in the past 3 1/2 years related to martial arts-related more traumatic knee injuries. I decided I needed to get stronger, so I started going to CrossFit and have gotten hooked.  I enjoy the training and community there a lot.  My plan is to take this next year and really focus on getting stronger through CrossFit.  My question is on how to not completely lose my aerobic endurance during this process.  I’d ideally like to be able to at least run a 10K without too much trouble. I currently do CrossFit 3 days per week (M/W/F) and martial arts 3 days per week (Tu/Th/Sa).  I’ve only been running once a week (Sun), and it doesn’t feel like enough to maintain running fitness.</p>
<p>Questions:<br />
1.  How many endurance sessions per week would be good in this situation?  Keeping in mind the fact that I’ve got a job and 3 busy teenage kids at home&#8230;&#8230;<br />
2.  Should I just run, or do one session each of run, bike, swim?<br />
3.  Should my endurance sessions mostly be done in Zone 2/MAF range?  Or does this not matter given the low volume?<br />
4.  When would be the best days to fit in the endurance training to allow for recovery from all of this?  Should I double up on the CF days?  Or on the martial arts days?  (Btw training intensity at martial arts is not too high &#8211; it’s much more technique-focused).</p>
</div>
<h3>What the Coaches say:</h3>
<ul>
<li>How much do you want to sacrifice? You would have to sacrifice CrossFit or martial arts.</li>
<li>How much <em>can</em> you do? How dedicated are you to the 10k?</li>
<li>You have a good baseline that you can fall back on. If you want to <em>finish</em> a 10k, you wouldn&#8217;t have to change anything. One long run a week is plenty.</li>
<li>Most importantly, continue to enjoy what you&#8217;re doing! Enjoy yourself above everything else.</li>
<li>You have a good mix of everything: the power from Crossfit, the distance from running, and martial arts is a central and peripheral nervous system based movement.</li>
<li>Stick to one run a week, but if you can add another one, then do so. But do not add the run <em>before</em> a martial arts or a Crossfit workout. Martial arts and Crossfit are skill-based workouts, and fatigue hinders your skill; as an injury prevention method, you do not want your legs to be weak before you do one of these workouts.</li>
<li>One way to tweak adding in another run would be to add it in after the Crossfit workout (when you&#8217;re tired). 3 miles when you&#8217;re fresh and rested vs. when you&#8217;re you&#8217;re already tired are two different workouts.</li>
<li>Dedicated athletes tend to forgo enjoyment for the sake of doing what is right.</li>
<li>Biking could be a good way to add some aerobic fitness with little risk of injury.</li>
<li>Create your own Crossfit workout that includes more running. Run intervals in conjunction with CrossFit might be a good way to fill in some gaps. Be very gentle! It would be easy to overdue the CrossFit portion, so don&#8217;t push too hard (i.e., use bodyweight movements). To lessen the strain on your knees, you may want to do core and upper body workouts for the first few sessions, then as you test your durability, you can gradually add on to that (e.g., air squats, wall sits). Isometrics are a very effective way to develop strength without compromising structure. Modify everything as needed!</li>
<li>You can also substitute the running with some biking intervals in conjunction with Crossfit.</li>
<li>Questions to potentially reflect on: What does it mean to run a 10k for you right now? Do you want to finish, or do you want to perform? Why does a run 1x a week not feel enough?</li>
<li>You can also oscillate between running and Crossfit, while not going overboard. Some weeks can lean towards more running and some towards Crossfit.</li>
<li>Even a 10-minute jog after a Crossfit class counts for something!</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Lindsay asks:</b></h2>
<h3><b>Tapering?!</b></h3>
<div>
<p>Hi Tawnee. I love your show and look forward to it every week. It broke my heart to hear about Siri Lindley. What an exceptional human being. She&#8217;ll be in my thoughts. I have a general question about tapering and the conventional wisdom. Most coaches seem to say that during your taper you should cut way back on volume, but maintain intensity, even for Ironman distances. They also say that the longer the race the longer your taper. This all seems backwards to me since you gain and lose endurance so much faster than you gain and lose speed or even muscular endurance. Wouldn&#8217;t it make more sense for iron people to reduce training stress by reducing intensity and leave their endurance workouts alone? And wouldn&#8217;t that suggest that iron people should have the shortest tapers, since we can&#8217;t even skip one long run without feeling it the next week? I&#8217;m wondering if the conventional wisdom is extrapolated from studies on shorter-distance athletes. It makes perfect sense that if you&#8217;re training for a 5k you can taper with plenty of intensity and lower overall volume since a good training plan gets progressively more race-specific. I also suspect that any athlete benefiting from a three week taper is really just recovering from overtraining. Am I thinking about this wrong? Is this just wishful thinking? I hate messing up my beautiful training routine for some silly race haha.</p>
</div>
<h3>What the Coaches say:</h3>
<ul>
<li>They disagree a little that you gain and lose endurance much faster than you gain and lose speed; it goes back to the baseline.</li>
<li>The taper is meant to elevate you for your race. Your taper is determined entirely on the previous 8-12 weeks.</li>
<li>The point of a taper is for compensation. You have to go into a state of overreaching (or be at your peak) before your taper.</li>
<li>Lucho is a fan of the decay taper (a slow, gradual reduction).</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t maintain intensity during a taper. There is a 40-60% reduction in <em>volume</em> intensity.</li>
<li>Keeping <em>frequency</em> may help with avoiding staleness and keeping everything loose and activated.</li>
<li>Tapering can be so individualized, though.</li>
<li>The main goal is to reduce fatigue.</li>
<li>If you use Training Peaks, an easy metric to look at is Form.</li>
<li>Your confidence going into a race trumps everything!</li>

<p>Welcome to episode 15 of Holistic Performance Nutrition (HPN) featuring <a href="http://coachtawnee.com/">Tawnee Gibson</a>, MS, CSCS, CISSN, and Julie McCloskey, a certified holistic nutrition coach who you can find over at <a href="http://wildandwell.fit/">wildandwell.fit</a>.</p>
<p>On this episode:</p>
<h2><strong>Anonymous asks:</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Is LCHF bad for bone health?</strong></h3>
<p>Hi Tawnee and Julie. Long time listener and a few-times question writer— thanks for all the great advice! Yesterday I read an article about a study (<a href="https://runningmagazine.ca/health-nutrition/keto-diet-may-damage-bone-health-in-endurance-athletes-study-shows/">link to article</a>) that found that suggested that low carb or keto diets can have negative effects on bone health. I’ve been fairly low carb since my early teens (I’m now 25), but definitely dealt with some disordered eating, through my background with a competitive weight class based sport. I had a brief bout of amenorrhea in junior high, but have since gone back to a normal cycle, and I think I sit at a healthy body weight (125lbs, 5’5). But I did jump on the keto train pretty early on, and maintained that for three half ironmans, and began to reintroduce more carbs as I was training for my first ironman in sept 2019 (think fruits, sweet potatoes, potato, beet chips, the occasional bread or rice), and then went back to a lower carb diet again in the fall post-ironman. This article about bone health worries me, especially since the birth control I’m on (depoprovera) is also known to decrease bone density. Do either of you have any thoughts on this? Even though my relationship with food has improved a lot over the years, the thought of switching back from a low carb diet sort of makes me panic. I wouldn’t know where to start, even though I can’t even remember why I think carbs are so bad. Should I add more carbs to my diet?</p>
<h3>What the Coaches say:</h3>
<p>The Study: <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2019.00880/full#F1">A Short-Term Ketogenic Diet Impairs Markers of Bone Health in Response to Exercise</a></p>
<p>Summary: long-term effects of the low-carb, high-fat (LCHF) diet are unknown, but this short-term study showed that a low carbohydrate diet has negative effects on the bone modeling and remodeling process.</p>
<ul>
<li>Only a 3.5-week intervention; the authors say that is was long enough to get adapted to low-carbs</li>
<li>Participants: elite race walkers; 23 males, 5 females</li>
<li>High carb condition was high</li>
<li>Low carb condition was low</li>
<li>Protein was also pretty high at 2g per kg</li>
<li>This was not about calories/energy availability; energy intake was matched for both conditions</li>
<li>Test block of a 2hr walk at 75% VO2max</li>
<li>3 times over the study (baseline, adaptation, restoration) they collected blood samples to get serum bone markers</li>
<li>A summary of the results: in the LCHF group, the marker for bone breakdown increased while it decreased in the level of bone formation (with only partial recovery) after a 3.5-week intervention while training at substantial rates.</li>
<li>Mechanism of breakdown: “Results from several studies have shown that if you start an endurance exercise with low glycogen availability then it stimulates the release of cytokine-interleukin6 from the exercising muscles. IL-6 has been hypothesized to increase the activity of another receptor (K B-ligand) which controls bone turnover by increasing bone breakdown.”</li>
<li>Bone health is just one of many reasons Tawnee does not recommend long-term keto for people, and specifically for women. &lt;100g carbohydrate a day is not safe and usually has unintended side effects.</li>
<li>This study also mentions, &#8220;to date, no studies have examined the effects of longer-term restriction of carbohydrates (CHO) at rest or in relation to exercise, although in animal models and children with intractable epilepsy, chronic adaptation to a ketogenic LCHF diet is associated with poor bone health.”</li>
<li>Is Louise Burke (a renowned sports scientist) anti keto? Somewhat. “The plural of anecdote isn’t evidence.”
<ul>
<li>Tawnee listened to a 2016 podcast with her on it discussing LCHF and she lands in the middle somewhere with a big emphasis on periodization. But at the end, she did say that she wouldn’t recommend LCHF for performance until there is more evidence for it, which is exactly what Tawnee would expect a seasoned scientist to say</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Low energy availability
<ul>
<li>When restricting ⅓ of your macronutrients, it becomes incredibly difficult to meet your energy needs as an endurance athlete</li>
<li>Have you replaced your carbs with anything substantial? Extra fat or protein? Might be in an energy deficit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For people without disordered eating, what does this study mean?
<ul>
<li>There is potential that going too low-carb for too long can lead to a decline in bone strength</li>
<li>Take it for what it is, and if you especially feel like you are LCHF and not meeting your energy needs as an athlete, start reintroducing more carbs and see how you feel</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do we have evidence elsewhere of long term keto on bone health?
<ul>
<li>Yes (see below). However, this was not a study of athletes!</li>
<li>Study: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24800673-long-term-effects-of-a-ketogenic-diet-on-body-composition-and-bone-mineralization-in-glut-1-deficiency-syndrome-a-case-series/">Long-term Effects of a Ketogenic Diet on Body Composition and Bone Mineralization in GLUT-1 Deficiency Syndrome: A Case Series</a>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Our data suggest that maintaining a ketogenic diet (KD) for more than 5 y does not pose any major negative effects on body composition, bone mineral content, and bone mineral density in adults with GLUT-1 DS, a finding that is at variance with previous reports focusing on children with intractable epilepsy. Further studies with larger sizes are needed to confirm and expand our findings.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Take home message:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We don&#8217;t need to be pushing hardcore keto year-round</li>
<li>For female athletes, step away</li>
<li>Start with small changes, <span style="font-weight: 400;">maybe make some oatmeal but use less oats and more chia seeds, nuts, or berries.</span></li>
<li>The scariest part of change is the thought of it, and how we’re certain it will cause us to lose control.</li>
<li>A question to ask yourself “how is this fear of carbohydrates serving me?”</li>
<li>If you’re going to trend toward lower-carb:
<ul>
<li>Be sure to get adequate food sources of calcium (see list below)</li>
<li>Foods high in calcium that aren’t starchy carbs or dairy (with more calcium than cow’s milk, i.e. between 150-350 mg calcium per serving compared to 138mg in 4oz cow’s milk):
<ul>
<li>¼ cup Sesame seeds</li>
<li>3.75 oz canned Sardines w/ bones</li>
<li>3 oz Canned wild salmon with bones&#8211;those bones!</li>
<li>1 cup Greens- collard greens, spinach, turnip greens, beet greens, mustard greens</li>
<li>Bok Choy</li>
<li> Almonds</li>
<li>1 tbsp molasses</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Most likely supplement with Vitamin D, K2 (we like <a href="https://thor.ne/x1fDG">Thorne D/K2 drops</a>).
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If D is below 30 ng/dl then that could signal a problem, definitely supplement.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vitamin D is not in that many foods; the sun is important. </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Vitamin A and Magnesium
<ul>
<li>Vitamin A: liver, egg yolk, cod liver oil (cod liver oil also has D)</li>
<li><a href="https://thor.ne/ftcpt">Magnesium bisglycinate by Thorne</a> + foods: spinach, pumpkin seeds, tuna, almonds, dark chocolate, avocados, bananas</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Weight-bearing exercise&#8211; spine and hips under load! Lift heavy things. Not just chronic endurance.</li>
<li>Check your stress! Chris Kresser states, “Cortisol indirectly acts on bone by blocking calcium absorption which decreases bone cell growth, and even a short bout of elevated cortisol may cause a decrease in bone mass. Several studies suggest that high cortisol may lead to decreased bone density.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Jessica W. asks:</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Intermittent Fasting for Women?</strong></h3>
<p>Hi. This is a question for the HPN podcast editions. I would love to hear your ladies’ take on intermittent fasting specifically for women but even more specifically for women over 40 who are endurance athletes. Is it useful from a general health perspective and/or performance perspective? I understand being fat adapted but is IF the way to go for women? What about increased cortisol levels caused by IF? When Brock and Lucho were hosting Endurance Planet they always talked about skipping breakfast (fashionably known as IF lol) but then in their answers to the ATC questions they would say things like, “Listen to your body.” How is IF listening to your body if you are ignoring hunger signals? Really enjoy all of the Endurance Planet shows. You are doing a fantastic job!</p>
<h3>What the Coaches say:</h3>
<p><strong>IF for women:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t IF if:
<ul>
<li>Recovering from adrenal imbalances</li>
<li>Recovering from an eating disorder</li>
<li>Struggling with severe insomnia with frequent waking</li>
<li>Trying to conceive &amp; have known hormone imbalances</li>
<li>Pregnant or postpartum</li>
<li>If lacking energy balance (under-eating or over-exercising); IF can give your body a further signal you are starving and does nothing to help your health or performance.</li>
<li>If struggling with cortisol imbalance or HPA axis dysfunction (often seen on DUTCH tests) it can be difficult to stabilize blood sugar. Compounded with long periods of no eating (daytime longer than 3 hours or overnight fast of 12+ hours) not only makes you feel worse but can worsen health.
<ul>
<li>Symptoms that you might see in these cases:  anxious, lightheaded, angry, short of breath, blurry-eyed, nauseated, alarm state/panic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Study: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29205517-within-day-energy-deficiency-and-reproductive-function-in-female-endurance-athletes/">Within-day Energy Deficiency and Reproductive Function in Female Endurance Athletes</a>
<ul>
<li>An observational study (not able to define a causal relationship between WDED and health)</li>
<li>The more time during the day that you spend in a negative energy balance, the more at risk you introduce for menstrual dysfunction (and RED-S symptoms), EVEN IF your total daily calories end up balancing out with your energy expenditure and 24hr energy availability is adequate (ie the MD and eumenorrheic athletes had similar energy availability overall, it&#8217;s just that the MD group didn&#8217;t balance out their calories very well within the day and spent too much time in negative energy balance). In other words, fasting all day then eating a ton in the evening is not a good strategy and still puts you at risk hormonally and otherwise</li>
<li>Don’t let body weight be your guide on how much you need to eat and/or IF.
<ul>
<li>“Most female athletes with long-term energy deficiency are reported to maintain a steady body weight and body composition within the normal range, independent of their reproductive function. Therefore, other metabolic mechanisms may be involved, such as a reduction in RMR and/or non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) 10, as well as in increased work-load efficiency.&#8221;</li>
<li>However, MD subjects had 19% lower FM and 14% lower relative FM compared to eumenorrheic subjects, although there were no differences in training volume or exercise capacity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Energy availability says a lot
<ul>
<li>“Low EA with or without disordered eating (DE) behavior is related to endocrine alterations leading to several health and performance impairing conditions including menstrual dysfunction (MD), gastrointestinal problems, impaired bone health, and increased injury risk.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Going under energy balance by -300 calories enough to tip you over into negative outcomes??
<ul>
<li>“A desirable range of EB of ± 300 kcal has been suggested, since 300 kcal corresponds to the predicted amount of liver glycogen for female athletes. Exceeding the threshold of EB below -300 kcal, could potentially accelerate biochemical pathways associated with energy deficiency20 and compromise brain glucose availability and thereby normal gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neuron activity and luteinizing hormone (LH) pulsatility.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What this study looked at:
<ul>
<li>Investigate if female elite endurance athletes with menstrual disturbance (MD) with similar reported 24-hour EB and EA as eumenorrheic athletes spend more time in a catabolic state and have a larger magnitude of within-day energy deficiency (WDED) compared to eumenorrheic athletes. Furthermore, it was our intent to investigate if WDED is associated with suppressed RMR and endocrine alterations in these athletes.</li>
<li>25 subjects, 15 with MD</li>
<li> Results:
<ul>
<li>24 hr EA and EB was similar</li>
<li>No association between body comp and WDED</li>
<li>Subjects with MD had lower RMRratio (measured RMR/predicted RMR), lower estrogen, higher cortisol, and a trend toward lower T3</li>
<li>Subjects with MD spent more time with EB &lt; 0 kcal and &lt; -300 kcal compared to eumenorrheic subjects (Table 3).</li>
<li>smaller magnitudes of hourly energy deficits (closer to 0 kcal) were associated with higher estrogen levels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Subjects with MD had significantly more meals/snacks per day compared to eumenorrheic subjects
<ul>
<li>A sub-analysis, excluding oligomenorrheic subjects, showed a more pronounced difference between amenorrheic (n = 11) and eumenorrheic subjects in EB.</li>
<li>The more hours spent with energy balance EB &lt; 0 kcal and &lt; -300 kcal (eg catabolic state), the lower the RMRratio and estrogen and the higher the cortisol levels (Table 4). In addition, smaller magnitudes of hourly energy deficits (closer to 0 kcal) were associated with higher estrogen levels.</li>
<li>Athletes with MD spent 24% more hours in EB &lt; -300 kcal compared to eumenorrheic athletes, providing a potentially more profound catabolic state.</li>
<li>Animal studies suggest that the reproductive function is responsive to hourly changes in metabolic fuel.</li>
<li>Loucks and Thuma demonstrated that women with a shorter luteal phase (11 days) are more susceptible to energy deficiency in terms of endocrine alterations compared to women with longer luteal phases (12-14 days). As discussed by the authors, women that by nature have a slightly shorter luteal phase may be of an increased risk of developing MD when exposed to energy deficiency.</li>
<li>Thus, the eumenorrheic athletes with a high number of catabolic hours in the present study may be women with a more robust reproductive function. On the other hand, it is unknown whether these athletes may have had subclinical MDs associated with energy deficiency such as anovulation or luteal phase abnormality.</li>

<h2><strong style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Natalie asks:</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>How to not be a stressed out athlete?</strong></h3>
<p>As coaches and athletes, you guys are no strangers to &#8220;what it takes&#8221; and also no stranger to pushing yourself beyond what is healthy, like Dr. Phil Maffetone said- fit but unhealthy athletes. Most if not all of us endurance athletes go through it at some point: a lot of added stress trying to &#8220;do it all.&#8221; It&#8217;s not signing up for the race/challenges that&#8217;s stressful, it&#8217;s finding the time and pushing our bodies to get the work done- from the moment we wake up to the moment we hit the pillow. Waking up at 4am to train, fitting in more training after work or when kids are at school, or anywhere between. Plus all of life&#8217;s non-sport demands that keep us on the go all day. Kid time. Jobs. Tension with our partner over training &amp; time spent away. Our intentions are genuine, but sometimes figuring this all out can push us into a big stress state (or burnout) even when we&#8217;re trying to avoid that.<br />
This show helps us be healthier athletes, so how can we pursue our goals in sport and not be so stressed out about how to get it all done- mentally stressed and physically overstressed? How do we keep our body in check when we&#8217;re asking a lot of it? How do we keep a positive mindset about how our fitness is progressing when we know &#8220;it could always be better if we had more time&#8221;? Or missing workouts? Or the sacrifices? Even healthy eating can be another stress to find the time for cooking and food prep!</p>
<h3>What the Coaches say:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Imbalance and sacrifice <em>has</em> to happen. It&#8217;s important to be aware of what you&#8217;re sacrificing and be ok with it.</li>
<li>Eliminate doubt to keep a positive mindset. Look back at your training logs and see when you missed workouts. Can you see how they helped you recover better so you could actually progress?</li>
<li>Have a coach who is sympathetic.</li>
<li>Shift expectations for your race goals until life settles down.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t fall into the &#8220;no pain, no gain&#8221; or FOMO traps.</li>
<li>Practice fighting the urge to become irritable and moody when you&#8217;re forced to skip a workout. Reframe the negativity: ask yourself, &#8220;What can I take away from this day?&#8221; Develop the mindfulness skills to be ok with whatever happens.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s better to show up for a race undertrained than wrecked and overtrained.</li>
<li>Learn how to set boundaries so you don&#8217;t push yourself over the edge.</li>
<li>Be mindful of your spouse&#8217;s communication methods to express his/her discontent with your workouts. Pick up on that and work through those issues directly. You can&#8217;t just ask your partner to accept all the time you spend away doing workouts&#8230; they have to receive something too. Perhaps compromise or negotiate.</li>
<li>DON&#8217;T TRY TO BE PERFECT!</li>
<li>At the end of the day, you chose this life for yourself. Remember <em>why</em>. Get back to the root of why you are where you are.</li>
<li>You can always bail on a race if you feel like it&#8217;s having a truly negative effect on your family and life. Prioritize what&#8217;s really important.</li>
<li>In terms of food, prep ahead!</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Rose asks:</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Long Run Duration For Masters Marathoner</strong></h3>
<p>Hello Tawnee and Lucho and other coaches:<br />
I am running the Big Five marathon in South Africa on the Entanbi Game Preserve on June 20th, 2020.  I am a 52 year old female and I have run 9 marathons. My last marathon was in 2017 in Bar Harbor, Maine.  I am prone to injury. I tend to have issues with my piriformis and also some tendinitis and planter fasciitis in the feet.  My only goal is really to finish and since I&#8217;ve done quite a few marathons, I know the basics of training. However, I do want a little bit of structure and help so I have signed up with Coach Mosley, who offers training plans and minimal coaching through email. (<a href="https://www.myprocoach.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.myprocoach.net/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1582394645064000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEPidi2cMJhha0pThzcqZ2PSoyMrA">https://www.myprocoach.net/</a>)  I signed up for the masters intermediate training plan.  The longest run on this plan is 2 hours 45 minutes. I was concerned about this and sent an email to the coaches.  My last couple of marathons have been over 5 hours and so it makes me a bit nervous to have the longest run before the marathon be less than 3 hours.  Here is their response:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Length of Long Run</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&#8220;It is a good question and I am happy to explain the reasoning. You&#8217;re right, the longest Aerobic Endurance Run in your plan is 2 hours 45 minutes in Week 14.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>There is no doubt that a 3-hour run (or longer) can be a great confidence booster. However from a training and physiological standpoint, there are more downsides than upsides.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>One of the most common reasons that marathoners don&#8217;t make it to the start line is injury. Our training plans will gradually and safely progress your endurance to a point that you will be able to complete your marathon strongly.&#8221; </em></p>
<p>I agree with them 100% that injury is a big concern, particularly for master runners like myself who are prone to injury when I increase my distance.  However, the South African race on a game preserve is on a difficult course. They have a 7 hour cutoff time and I&#8217;m pretty confident I can make it. Also, there will be wild animals out there and so I&#8217;m not joking when I say I don&#8217;t want to be the slowest runner. I&#8217;m thinking about increasing my long runs a little just so I have the confidence to finish the race.  I&#8217;m not sure if I should try to do 5 hours. I know that time on my feet is really important. Another idea I had is to split my running with this elliptical machine at my gym called the Octane Fitness Elliptical.  It really seems to mimic running. I know it&#8217;s not a substitute, but I thought it could help by keeping me on my feet for longer, but not increasing my chance of injury like running would. Any advice you can give would be great.  I&#8217;m 18 weeks out so I&#8217;m hoping you might get to my question while I&#8217;m still in my early training days. As I mentioned to Tawnee in an email, I love your show and all the advice you give.  It&#8217;s also cool that Lucho lives in Colorado; I&#8217;m a Colorado native who lives in Lakewood. Thanks!</p>
<h3>What the Coaches say:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Confidence is important to consider (though it doesn&#8217;t mean you should throw caution to the wind).</li>
<li>2:45 is an arbitrary number. Since you <em>have</em> done 5-hour runs before, Lucho thinks you can likely do 3-4 hours in training. The key is to only run so long as you feel good and healthy. Don&#8217;t push it just to hit a number.
<ul>
<li>You can use your watch to help determine this. If you&#8217;re noticing a drop-off (1-min per mile slower) in your mile splits, then it&#8217;s time to stop.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A hilly course might be able to extend your volume.</li>
<li>On your long runs leading up to the longest run, be mindful of how you&#8217;re feeling. You know yourself better than anyone else. Go shorter or longer depending on how you feel. Blend your experience with the schedule.</li>
<li>The elliptical could be a helpful tool if you feel inclined to do it.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Ahmed asks:</b></h2>
<h3><b>Does MAF HR change for each sport?</b></h3>
<div>Avid listener, especially about MAF training and keto/HFLC. I came from a running background of track and cross country in high school and college, but transitioned to road cycling about 5 years ago. At this point, running is just an adjunct to my cycling when it’s raining, snowing, or the days are too short to ride when I get home from work. On the bike, I primarily keep my HR at MAF or below. I’m 37, so 143 is my MAF HR, but I’ve been steadily improving my FTP each year over the past 5 years, so I use Phil’s adjustment criteria to add 5 bpm, to raise my MAF ceiling to 148. I try to keep it at 143 or well below, but on hills, or after a few hours in the saddle, it may drift up to 147-148, then I’ll let it come back down. Also, I’ve been injury free, no illness or sickness, and no medications, so I pass all of Phil’s other criteria to subtract bpm.<br />
Anyway, my question is, should I use the same MAF HR for running as I do for cycling? Again, I rarely run anymore, maybe 2-3x/month on avg. So my running muscles are never really in tip top shape compared to my cycling muscles. At 143bpm I can comfortably run 7:15-7:30 pace for a 4-5 mile run, but for longer runs of 8-10 miles, I get a little cardiac drift (due to muscular fatigue I guess?), and my avg pace at 143 bpm is more like 7:30-8min.<br />
So due to my inconsistency in running at this point in my life, would Tawnee and Lucho advise running below MAF? Or doing a running MAF test? The last thing I want to do is create a stress hormone spike from running a bit too hard.<br />
Also, I’ve been trying to implement Brad Kearns primal sprint strategy of doing a few short sprints (6-10 sec x 6) every 7-10 days, after warming up of course. Would you guys support the sprinting approach as a HIIT type muscular stimulus?<br />
Sorry that these questions are a bit vague, but I’ve been puzzled about at what HR I should be running now a days, since it’s something I’m not doing regularly.<br />
Thanks in advance, and hope to hear back on an upcoming podcast!<br />
Ahmed from Team Velocipede in Fairfax, Va.</div>
<div>
<h3>What the Coaches say:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Yes, your run MAF should be the same as your bike. Don&#8217;t increase it. You <em>could</em> lower it, though.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.enduranceplanet.com/paul-laursen-hiit-it-how-and-why-to-add-high-intensity-interval-training-to-your-endurance-program-with-success/">Check out our previous episode on HIIT</a></li>
<li>Cardiac drift won&#8217;t be a guide to a hormone spike, per se. Any run that&#8217;s long enough to <em>cause</em> cardiac drift may put you in dangerous territory hormonally. But the cardiac drift isn&#8217;t the cause of a hormone spike.</li>
<li>Decide what your priority is: are you trying to get faster or are you trying to be healthy? You really don&#8217;t need to be running 10 miles if 4 miles is a sufficient stimulus.</li>
<li>Consider doing some other kind of activity that complements your cycling (something more power related).</li>
<li>MAF can be an overall benchmark of health and fitness, but it&#8217;s not the end all be all.</li>

<p>Our guest on this episode is Dr. Julian Abel, who spent his clinical life as a palliative care specialist doctor where he developed a special interest in compassionate communities, initially as part of supporting people undergoing experiences of death, dying, loss and caregiving. Over the last 4 years, he has worked with Frome Medical Practice applying the compassionate community approach to healthcare in general, with some startling results. He is Director of Compassionate Communities UK, a charity which aims to share the lessons learnt in both palliative care and primary care more broadly. Julian is also an accomplished endurance runner who loves MAF, running with his dogs, spending time with family, surfing the UK coastline, practicing daily meditation, and making his health a priority. On this conversation, we share the power of becoming a healthier athlete via increased quality social connections and cultivating more compassion as well as how to take small steps to be a happier, healthier, more empathetic human, and overcoming loneliness.</p>

<li>Social relationships have a profound impact on health</li>
<li>A public health approach to palliative care through <a href="http://phpci.info/become-compassionate-cities">Compassionate Communities</a>

<li class="p1">Progressions: volume first</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Strength training discussion:</h3>
<ul>
<li>When we see studies that say strength &amp; conditioning (S&amp;C) did not protect against injuries for runners, does that mean we can and should skip S&amp;C because it&#8217;s not effective at preventing injury? Or is it something else that&#8217;s faulty in a study like this (e.g. poor programming/doing dumb stuff/lack of specificity, overtraining in running, lack of recovery, etc.)?</li>
<li><a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/publishahead/Strength_and_Conditioning_Habits_of_Competitive.95728.aspx">This study</a> says: &#8220;Injury frequency was associated with typical weekly running volume and run frequency. Strength and conditioning did not seem to confer a protection against the number of injuries the runners experienced. Practitioners working with distance runners should critically evaluate the current S&amp;C practices of their athletes, to ensure that activities prescribed have a sound evidence-based rationale.&#8221;</li>
<li>What the coaches say:
<ul>
<li>Study facts:
<ul>
<li>667 total included m/f</li>
<li>67% were doing 5k to HM</li>
<li>67.4% injured in last year</li>
<li>Stretching and core work most popular</li>
<li>2/3 of respondents did some type of resistance training</li>
<li>S&amp;C did not seem to be associated with lower injury rates, but higher running volume was correlated with a higher injury rate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ray P. asks:</h2>
<h3>Creating Realistic Race Goals</h3>
<p>I’ve enjoyed listen to your show and have gained a lot of knowledge as I continue through the MAF method. I’ve recently done several months of MAF zone running in preparation for the Fargo Half Marathon on 9 May. My question is how to properly set realistic, but challenging, goals for the race. I recently ran a 5k in 28:59 (yes I’m proud of that 1 second below 29:00) and would like to set proper goals for the half. I’m using the 16 week Garmin Half Marathon Level 2 heart rate plan where I use the MAF zone any time the plan calls for easy and long runs.</p>
<h3>What the Coaches say:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Start using your expected/goal pace range for the half-marathon during your long run and notice how it feels. Can you conceptualize yourself holding that pace for 13.1 miles? You will get faster on your long runs as you continue to train.</li>
<li>Test your fitness growth every few weeks with a 5K; the frequency of doing this depends upon your fitness level and volume.</li>
<li>Consider your goal pace in relation to your MAF. There are a lot of variables here.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Craig asks:</h2>
<h3>What to do when your kid&#8217;s coach gives poor or inaccurate information?</h3>
<p>For all parents of child athletes (or one-day athletes) out there-As Cora gets older and eventually into sports, what will you do when the information coaches give is old and inaccurate? Like eating fat is bad. Or to static stretch before a game. Will you step in? This is probably an issue many of us EP educated athletes will face one day, you included.</p>
<h3>What the Coaches say:</h3>
<ul>
<li class="li1">Negate easy stuff like, “Fat is bad” to your kid at home. Having conversations at home is key. For example, if your kid is getting exposed to Gatorade at practices and games, have a dialogue with them about sugar.</li>
<li class="li1">Don’t contradict the coach in front of everyone at practice.</li>
<li class="li1">Don’t interfere in a coach’s program unless they’re doing harm. Even then, try to have a tactful, non-confrontational conversation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Chad B. asks:</h2>
<h3>Preparing for a 24hr event</h3>
<p>I am preparing for a 24 hr event doing pull-ups looking to break the record, but I wanted to try to review some training and nutrition for preparing for that event. Can you share what might be a good process to increase volume of work in prep? If the event is 24 hrs should you build up to a 12 hr training session?</p>
<h3>What the Coaches say:</h3>
<ul>
<li class="li1">Do NOT do a 12-hour training session.</li>
<li class="li1">Progressive overload is an important concept here.</li>
<li class="li1">Grip strength is clearly key.</li>
<li class="li1">Definitely eat a lot of protein (3g per kg of bodyweight) <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
<li class="li1">Hire a nutritionist of some kind to outline a plan (including supplements).</li>
<li class="li1">Cutting weight in the last 8-weeks will be important.</li>
<li class="li1">Heavy loaded pull-ups will be a helpful training technique (developing critical power).</li>
<li class="li1">Rowing might be a good way to build endurance. Or some kind of cardio/strength interval training.</li>
<li class="li1">Isometrics and eccentric exercises will be helpful.</li>
<li class="li1">Don’t neglect antagonist muscles.</li>
<li class="li1">Lower back and glutes help stabilize pull-ups.</li>

<h2>Lisa asks:</h2>
<h3>Histamine intolerance- how to diagnose, what foods to avoid, and is there a fix?</h3>
<p>Hi, Thanks for the show! We are told all the time to eat fermented foods, bone broth, eggs, and also many of us who are busy athletes are doing food prep on weekends thus eating leftovers throughout the week. But I think I am having histamine intolerance, and I read those foods are high in histamine. Should I avoid those foods? Are there other foods to avoid? And also how can I verify that I am in fact having a histamine reaction? And if so can I fix it? Some background: I am training for marathons, have been for several years. Female, 36 years old, and worried that maybe I’m having some gut issues and signs of being a bit run down.</p>
<h3>What the Coaches say:</h3>
<p><strong>Histamine:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Chemical naturally found in some foods; also produced by the body</li>
<li>Forms when the amino acid histidine is transformed into histamine</li>
<li>Any food containing protein can form histamine under the right conditions</li>
<li>Function &#8211; to fight off pathogens in our gut. It stimulates our immune system to release killer chemicals that attack the dangerous invaders and keeps our body safe</li>
<li>Motility &#8211; keeps things moving, excretes the waste and toxins</li>
<li>Acid &#8211; helps our stomach secrete the acids it needs to digest protein</li>
<li>We want histamine, but not too much. An excess can falsely trigger our immune system to release killer chemicals and create inflammation, but since it’s a false alarm and there’s no actual enemy to kill, our immune system is overstimulated for nothing and it ends up hurting us</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What’s happening during a histamine reaction?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When our histamine bucket overflows it generally looks like an allergic reaction with flushing, watery eyes, nasal drip, and a bunch of other stuff listed below</li>
<li>1% of the population has histamine intolerance and most are middle-aged women</li>
<li>Histamine is released from immune cells when they detect a threat</li>
<li>When released, it triggers smooth muscle contraction in the intestines (often causing cramps and diarrhea), expansion of blood vessels (often causing low blood pressure), mucus secretion in the nasal passages and GI tract, and many other physiologic effects that are intended to fight off invaders</li>
<li>More common histamine reaction; e.g. a foreign protein triggers histamine release such as pollen, bee sting, pet hair, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Most Common Signs/Symptoms of Histamine Intolerance:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Itching, redness, hives and/or swelling of the lips, tongue, or skin</li>
<li>Red eyes</li>
<li>Swollen eyelids</li>
<li>Atopic eczema</li>
<li>Sneezing and nasal congestion</li>
<li>Asthma</li>
<li>Low blood pressure</li>
<li>Heart arrhythmia</li>
<li>Abdominal pain</li>
<li>Bloating</li>
<li>Diarrhea</li>
<li>Gas</li>
<li>Nausea</li>
<li>Vomiting</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Dizziness</li>
<li>Sleep disturbances</li>
<li>Menstrual irregularity</li>
<li>Chronic fatigue</li>
<li>Anxiety</li>
<li>Depression</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where is it coming from? What is the root cause?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mast cell activation syndrome. Estradiol can elicit activation of mast cells &gt; histamine release</li>
<li>Overactive/hypersensitive immune issue</li>
<li>The body has produced too much histamine because of an overactive mast cells/immune response
<ul>
<li>Intestinal bacteria will directly release histamine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hormones
<ul>
<li>High estrogen levels / estrogen dominance</li>
<li>Mast cell activation syndrome &#8211; Estradiol can elicit activation of mast cells &gt; histamine release.</li>
<li>Estrogen can also down-regulate the enzymes DAO and monoamine oxidase (MAO) which break down histamine.</li>
<li>“That time of the month” &#8211; symptoms common at the start of the menstrual period (or anywhere between ovulation and just before the period starts; i.e., higher estrogen luteal phase)</li>
<li>Also, higher likelihood at menopause, when estrogen levels are on the rise and progesterone is decreasing</li>
<li>Estrogen supplements may trigger histamine intolerance.</li>
<li>The histamine can then trigger more estrogen production- a vicious cycle!</li>
<li>What we want in this equation is more PROGESTERONE!
<ul>
<li>Can inhibit the release of histamine from mast cells</li>
<li>Increasing Prog to upregulate DAO</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The degradation of histamine is impaired
<ul>
<li>DAO is an enzyme that degrades histamine</li>
<li>Could be a genetic polymorphism that causes a DAO deficiency and thus high histamine</li>
<li>DAO is secreted from the microvilli in the intestine (also produced in the placenta during pregnancy), so any gut imbalance will increase chances of histamine intolerance</li>
<li>SIBO</li>
<li>Dysbiosis</li>
<li>Autoimmune (e.g., celiac, Crohns, non-celiac gluten insensitivity)</li>
<li>Viral/Bacterial Infection</li>
<li>Stress</li>
<li>Leaky gut</li>
<li>IBD</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exercise &amp; athlete tie-in with histamine:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Not quite the same as the general histamine reaction; more localized to muscle tissue</li>
<li>During exercise, histamine is released locally within the exercised muscle tissue; it comes from mast cells, and binds to receptors in muscle</li>
<li>Mast cells triggered during exercise due to localized inflammation, release histamine</li>
<li>Post-exercise role: histamine is a mediator of post-exercise hypotension and vasodilation</li>
<li>Helps increase blood flow- Likely that “histamine contributes to exercise hyperemia during prolonged physical activity (25), but this has not been tested.”</li>
<li>Skeletal muscle glucose and glycogen, “activation of histamine receptors following exercise modifies the delivery of glucose to recovering muscle groups.”</li>
<li>Overall, “relatively little is known about this molecule in the context of exercise physiology, but it appears to be a fundamental component of exercise responses in humans.”
<ul>
<li>Source: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27741023">The Intriguing Role of Histamine in Exercise Response</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Not a good idea to use antihistamines! We actually want this localized histamine response during and after exercise. Eg. relaxation of blood vessels, an increase in blood flow up to 2hr post, role in DOMS.
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Blocking histamine&#8217;s actions during muscle-damaging exercise, via common over-the-counter antihistamines, resulted in increased serum creatine kinase, an indirect marker of muscle damage. Paradoxically, blocking histamine&#8217;s actions attenuated muscle strength loss and reduced perceptions of muscle pain for 72 h following muscle-damaging exercise. These results indicate that exercise-induced histamine release may have a broad impact on protecting muscle from exercise-induced damage.&#8221;</li>
<li>Study: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27493198">A single dose of histamine-receptor antagonists before downhill running alters markers of muscle damage and delayed-onset muscle soreness</a></li>
<li>Instead, if having problems let’s look back to diet and lifestyle management outside of exercise!!
<ul>
<li>Might need to avoid eating immediately pre-exercise, eat 2+ hr prior. Low histamine foods, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to test?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Low-histamine diet for 4 weeks and then reintroduce</li>
<li>Serum DAO levels</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What to do? </strong></p>
<p>Start with the basics</p>
<ul>
<li>Run-down:
<ul>
<li>Cortisol may be dysregulated and immune system compromised (HPA AXIS)</li>
<li>Work on rebalancing cortisol levels through stress management techniques</li>
<li>Why is your body in such a fearful state that it is sounding the alarm of histamine so readily? Fight or flight mode</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Start with the elimination of inflammatory foods
<ul>
<li>Standard elimination diet 3-4 weeks
<ul>
<li>Paleo’ish; eliminate gluten, dairy, processed foods</li>
<li>Gut soothing and repair nutrients, antimicrobials</li>
<li>Then consider a Low FODMAP for 2-3 weeks to evaluate if it’s working</li>
<li>Then, thirdly, a low-histamine diet &#8211; very restrictive, low compliance</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Supplement:
<ul>
<li>Vitamin C &#8211; helps degrade histamine</li>
<li>Vitamin B6 &#8211; helps DAO do its job</li>
<li>Quercetin &#8211; a natural antihistamine</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>High-Histamine Foods:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The longer the maturation of the food, the higher in histamine. Generally, anything aged and fermented will be high in histamine</li>
<li>Aged Cheese &#8211; swiss, parmesan, cheddar, gouda, camembert</li>
<li>Alcohol &#8211; red wine has 3x more histamine</li>
<li>Bone Broth</li>
<li>Canned Fish &#8211; mackerel, sardines, tuna, herring</li>
<li>Fermented Foods &#8211; sauerkraut, kimchi, kefir, kombucha, miso, natto, tamari, coconut aminos</li>
<li>Fermented/Aged Meats &#8211; sausage, salami, pepperoni, hot dogs, etc.</li>
<li>Vegetables &#8211; spinach, tomatoes, eggplant</li>
<li>Fruits &#8211; avocado, dried fruit</li>
<li>Vinegars (pickles, mayo, olives) and yeast products</li>
<li>Leftovers</li>
<li>Soured Foods &#8211; sour cream, buttermilk, soured breads</li>
<li>Nuts &#8211; walnuts, cashews</li>
<li>Beans &#8211; chickpeas, soybeans</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Histamine-Releasing Foods:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Alcohol, bananas, chocolate, cow’s milk/cow’s dairy, nuts, papaya, pineapple, shellfish, strawberries, tomatoes, wheat germ, artificial preservatives, and dyes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DAO Blocking Foods (makes it hard for you to break down histamine):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Alcohol, energy drinks, green &amp; black tea</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Low-Histamine Foods:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>FRESH meat and seafood</li>
<li>All fruit and veg except eggplant, tomatoes, avocados, spinach, pineapple, papayas, dried fruits</li>
<li>Cooked eggs</li>
<li>Dairy Substitutes</li>
<li>Gluten-Free Grains &#8211; rice, amaranth, quinoa, teff, millet</li>
<li>Olive oil and coconut oil</li>
<li>Leafy herbs, herbal teas, coffee</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary of Advice: start by reducing stress so that your immune system isn’t so reactive. Lower training, add in meditation, increase supportive foods, get outside, get good sleep, hang with loved ones. Then work on reducing inflammatory foods that help heal the gut; starting with gluten, dairy, sugar and work your way down the line. Start a food journal if you’re pretty sure you’re reacting to a food but just can’t identify it.</p>
<h2>Calesse asks:</h2>
<h3>Hair Loss- Why?</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve got another one for you, a really long standing issue that perhaps you might be able to offer some insight on?  (If you pick my question to answer, unless you see fit, no need to read the entire question aloud as I&#8217;m going to give you some in depth background here). I am a female who has struggled with thinning hair and hair loss since my mid teens (now late 20s). At certain times it has been worse than others, but it seems to be a somewhat persistent problem for me. When I initially noted the onset of issue and it was at its worst, I was under a great deal of stress with my family frequently moving, I was running track and cross-country and swimming competitively during various school seasons, and I was restricting food intake and was underweight. Through high school I sought therapy and got a better handle on my nutrition and got back to a health weight for my height and build. I&#8217;ve been involved in endurance sports since childhood, competed at the D1 level in college, and now compete in local 5ks, 10ks, up to the marathon at an age group competitive level. Over the past 5 years, my weekly mileage as ranged from 40-65 miles per week with a few sessions of light core/ lifting as well.</p>
<p>Despite nutritional supplements such as a multi-vitamin, biotin, and iron and eating what I believe to be a diet adequate to support my lifestyle and training, I still struggle with hair loss. I&#8217;ve been tested for thyroid issues and iron/ ferratin and they have all come back &#8220;within range.&#8221; I also have been taking birth control since the age of 17. My pediatrician initially put me on this to regulate my cycle after getting 1 period at the age of 17 and then not again (for the past two years it&#8217;s also actually be serving as contraception now that I am married). Thus, I don&#8217;t know what my natural hormone levels are as I&#8217;ve read that if female hormones are out of wack or cortisol even, this can affect hair growth.<br />
Even though I feel good at this training level, is it possible my training could be impacting this element of my health? Is there something I&#8217;m missing here? Any thoughts would be appreciated. P.S. I wash my hair with a mild shampoo and then conditioner and few times per week, air dry it, and am very gentle in everything I do with it.</p>
<h3>What the coaches say:</h3>
<p><strong>Possible reasons women lose hair:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Iron deficiency
<ul>
<li>Ferritin &lt;50 indicative of an iron issue</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Estrogen dominance/low progesterone</li>
<li>Any sex hormone imbalance</li>
<li>Check blood sugar regulation which can drive hormonal imbalance</li>
<li>Estrogen makes hair soft and silky while testosterone makes it thicker and coarser. Too much estrogen can make hair too thin and soft, and an oversupply of testosterone (unbalanced by enough female hormones) can make hair fall out</li>
<li>Thyroid problems (even subclinical)
<ul>
<li>Possibly thyroid issue if: TSH &gt; ~2.5, Free T3 &lt;3.0 or &gt;3.5, Free T4 &lt;1 or &gt;1.5, Reverse T3 &lt;8 or &gt;25</li>
<li>TPO Abs &gt;34</li>
<li>Thyroglobulin &gt;0.9</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.labtestingapi.com/packages/complete-thyroid-panel">thyroid panel </a> that Tawnee mentioned</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Autoimmune</li>
<li>Check ANA, RF, Thyroid ABs</li>
<li>Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, lupus, psoriasis, alopecia, and more</li>
<li>Inflammation</li>
<li>HsCRP &amp; ESR</li>
<li>High cortisol levels/HPA axis dysfunction</li>
<li>Stress balance, overtraining, etc.
<ul>
<li>High stress depletes us of vitamins and minerals</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Androgen dominance  (e.g. High testosterone, DHEA)</li>
<li>Possible signs of PCOS</li>
<li>High 5-alpha-reductase/DHT
<ul>
<li>The enzyme that converts T to DHT- find this out via <a href="https://dutchtest.com/shop/">DUTCH test</a>; DHT is potent androgen and indicated in male pattern baldness</li>
<li>If free T high, also check to see if SHBG is low (it binds to excess hormone)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Birth Control
<ul>
<li>“The AHLA believes that it is imperative for all women especially for those who have a history of hair loss in their family to be made aware of the potentially devastating effects of birth control pills on normal hair growth.”</li>
<li>Contraceptives with a high androgen index (more similar to testosterone than progesterone)</li>
<li>Medroxyprogesterone acetate, levonorgestrel, norgestrel, and etonogestrel. They cause hair loss by shrinking (or miniaturizing) hair follicles. It&#8217;s a slow process, you could be on the pill for years before your hair starts falling out</li>
<li>Contraceptives with a low androgen index</li>
<li>Drospirenone, norgestimate, and cyproterone
<ul>
<li>Don’t cause hair loss when you take them, but will when you stop them because of a rebound surge in androgens</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Not ovulating, not making your own estrogen and progesterone</li>
<li>Stress, iron deficiency, excess dieting, autoimmune or gluten allergy that damages the gut, insufficient protein, zinc, and EFA’s. Also, synthetic progestin can have an androgenic effect that can provoke hair loss</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Types of hair loss and what they mean
<ul>
<li>Overall thinning &#8211; stress, thyroid, hormones</li>
<li>Patchy- cortisol, B vitamins, heavy metals, autoimmune</li>
<li>Male pattern baldness/receding hairline &#8211; hormones like T, cortisol, estrogen, progesterone</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What do to?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Depends on the underlying root cause (see list above). Start by working with a functional medicine practitioner or health coach to dive deeper. Don’t start just throwing supplements at it or special shampoos.</li>
<li>That said, here are a few tips:
<ul>
<li>High fatty acids/omega-3s in diet</li>
<li>Moderate exercise, not excessive</li>
<li>Digestive support to make sure absorbing vitamins and nutrients in food</li>
<li>Improve nutrient intake and absorption</li>
<li>Protein and Omega 3’s</li>
<li>Pay attention to the frequency and quality of protein intake
<ul>
<li>Whether you&#8217;re active or not we need a minimum of 1.5 grams per kilogram of body weight for active individuals</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Zinc, Iron, Iodine, B’s</li>
<li>Reduce stress, training, increase digestion, modify diet, prioritize sleep</li>
<li>Be Patient</li>
<li>It will take at least 2 months. Once hair is pushed into the telogen phase (resting follicle stage) it will continue to fall out for 2-4 months later, you can’t really reverse it back into a growth phase. So you may continue to see hair loss even if applying the best treatment</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mike S. asks:</h2>
<h3>Food costs for athletes</h3>
<p>I’m keeping this short. What advice do you have for minimizing food costs as much as possible while still maintaining high nutritional value?<br />
There are two things I can’t change: I need to eat low carb (not keto) and I need to eat meat. My body and mind just perform a lot better so long as I maintain those two requirements. I also love my vegetables.<br />
I currently spend $500/month on food, which is ridiculous. I have high caloric needs, but I also have a ton of student loans I’d like to pay off.<br />
Thank you as always. You are the best.</p>
<h3>What the coaches say:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Walden Local &#8211; quality meat and fish CSA in the NE that delivers to Concord</li>
<li>Misfits Market &#8211; organic fruit and veg delivery box, 40% less than what you’d find in stores! Each box has 12 different types of fruit and veg, weighs between 10-13lbs and feeds 2 people for a week for $22 or an 18-22lb box for $35 said to feed 5 people per week</li>
<li>Thrive Market for the staples
<ul>
<li>Tawnee&#8217;s stats as a 5-year Thrive member: projected annual savings is over $700 (lifetime savings over $3k after 5 years!)</li>
<li>Join at <a href="https://www.enduranceplanet.com/shop/">EndurancePlanet.com/shop;</a> which also helps support the podcast!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cut out the middleman and buy at farmers market/veg stands/join a CSA. Hunt. Forage. Grow your own veg and herbs</li>
<li>In stores: don’t buy at eye level, take your time in the store and look up and down the shelves. Make a list and stick to it. Only buy what is on sale. Buy in bulk. Skip the packaging. Shop in season. Cook lots and freeze meals. Try different grocery stores. Shop the ugly fruit and veg bin. Buy discounted items that are about to go bad.</li>
<li>Next month apply some of these things and only allow yourself to spend $450, then $400, and see how low you can get it while still fulfilling your needs</li>
